    <pre>Iron Maiden: &quot;Loneliness Long Distance Runner&quot; Lyrics | AZLyrics.com  
Loneliness Long Distance Runner lyrics by Iron Maiden

Tough track, wind and rain beat heart, loud go get loud  
Go till sound rings in head, step, tread, breath  
Determination makes the run stop  
Got to win, got to run till drop  
Pace holds the race, mind gets clear  
Halfway mile ends, dream gets futile  

Run! Run! Loneliness Long Distance Runner, get run course  
Get run, win costs going strong, determined push  
Run! Run! Stile field turn, look heel way ahead  
Field line gets near.

Want glory go reach final stretch ideal trace feel like throw race futile Run Run loneliness long distance runner Run Run loneliness long distance runner Submit Corrections writer(s) Stephen Percy Harris AZLyrics Iron Maiden Lyrics album Time Machine 1986 catch time waste Years Sea Madness Heaven wait Loneliness Long Distance Runner Stranger Strange Land Deja Vu Alexander great like Metallica memory remain Fortune fame Mirror vain go insane memory remain Heavy ring finger wave star deny grave crowd cry tear honor like twisted vine Megadeth ã Tout Le Monde remember realize life game seriously take thing hard rule idea cost life pass eye find.
