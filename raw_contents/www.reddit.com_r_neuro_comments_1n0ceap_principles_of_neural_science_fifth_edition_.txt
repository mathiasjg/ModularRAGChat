I know I can just download a pdf for free, but I love physical books, so does anyone have a copy of Principles of Neural Science (preferably 5th edition bc my prof is really stressing that he likes this edition best for some reason) that they just have lying around and would be willing to sell for me for kinda cheap?People don't usually sell this book. Either because it fell apart or it's used as a door stop, or as a reference guide.

If you do manage to get one be prepared for the binding to fall apart. Fix it with flexible silicone glue, anything that gets hard and brittle will just break again under the weight. The new edition that is out has a lot of updates. Best to get the new one. Maybe eBay, someone has it and is trying to get rid of it.Â  Library?  Inter-library loan?
