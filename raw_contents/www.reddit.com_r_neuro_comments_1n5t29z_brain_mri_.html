When we look at MRIs clinically, we look at all kinds of different imaging sequences and scan through the entire brain. I&#x27;m like 99% sure this is a human head. It&#x27;s as interesting as any other head MRI. In the UK at least, if they see anything in your scans that looks disease related they pass your information on to a clinician who takes a look and contacts you if the concerns are warranted. If you weren&#x27;t contacted you are fine.

Your scan looks fine to me but I don&#x27;t work on humans. Cool images. What kind of tasks were you doing? Memory tasks? OP, suggest you upload everything you have into ChatGPT and report back your results. I have multiple brain scan MRI&#x27;s. Sadly the resolution of each slice are rather shitty. nice to see the donders on here haha. very normal looking section. completely unremarkabke omg i got more scansðŸ˜­ i got the dicom file, for someone who doesnt know anything about radiology it looks so weirdâ€¦.</pre></body></html>
