No one should read or believe anything they put out. I&#x27;ll be scared once self-checkout works on its own without a human aide standing by to help every 10 seconds. 

30 years and counting... How is AI going to negatively impact farming? Machinery? Genuinely curious. Machines have been taking jobs for decades.  Look at self check outs! Just imagine if our society used this to liberate workers. Instead, people are fired because a tenth the people can produce the same output and 9 people end up on the street. 

The market forces of capital will drive us towards that. It’s the job of government to protect us from that future because I can promise you there is no incentive for corporations to do so. I say this plainly: I don’t blame them! That’s their job. It’s not their job to protect people it’s their job to make money. One fourth, also known as a quarter People thought mathematicians were fucked when the calculator was invented. They quickly realized that you still have to understand the theory and it’s applications for any of it’s output to mean anything. 

GPT, although more disruptive, is a powerful tool that will make professionals in there industries more efficient. Isn’t there only 166 million people working in the US right now? They even have Bricklaying robots now but I don’t see them being used very much. So if AI takes tons or jobs will they provide housing and electricity for all of the people who will be out of work? What about recreation and hobbies? Will people have the means to be able to do their passion hobby or craft they enjoy in life if robots take half the jobs someday? I think it will be up to people in the middle and upper class to boycott big corporations that use robots and buy handmade goods and products like furniture  and art and pottery etc. Just to name a few. It might cost more but your supporting a family by buying those products and not being cheap and buying cheap junk made in a factory of robots. Sure I know quality products can be made by robots too but we will have to be willing to support each other and be willing to pay a little more to do so. Pretty tame prediction, once there are effective physical components for the AI to use it&#x27;ll be far more than 300 million. Every part of my sales job is already AI automated, except for the human interaction that is necessary for the role.  Nothing new to us I start college next year... What&#x27;s my best move? I planned computer science It&#x27;s not could be, it&#x27;s will be. [deleted] Why does it matter? If we don’t have to work and we can focus on what we want in life I don’t see the issue. Exciting Right I wonder if the same fear-mongering happened with the disappearance of the ice man, typewriter factory workers, and the folks who delivered the Yellow Pages door to door.

We&#x27;re gonna be OK. Jobs change, they don&#x27;t go away. We&#x27;ve been &quot;eliminating&quot; jobs for centuries, and meanwhile increasing the global population (the number of people who need jobs) and despite the hype, it&#x27;s been OK. &quot;Affected&quot; That could mean destroyed, or it could mean improved. Also, no one seems to want to talk about the jobs that will be created by AI.

Why did seemingly everyone become a Luddite overnight? What about 3 billion? I don’t understand so if someone would care to explain- why are we calling this AI? Isn’t it an algorithm or chatbot? I’m not savvy to the terms so please forgive. From what I understand real AI is a far off, possibly unachievable technology. Thoughts? Im curious how management is going to be automated There are so many impediments to AI wholesale eliminating jobs.  Data security and data privacy jobs are going to explode in a world with more prolific AI. Good. Let it. Let’s get 300 million people out of work so we finally have the free time to protest and revolt against our wealthy overlords. No more bullshit jobs, no one has to work anymore. Why is engineering up there?? I don’t think sales should be on here. Someone would much rather do business with a human than a robot. [removed] Don’t know about y’all but usually anytime I go somewhere I havent been for awhile and find out staff or a service has been replaced by something I can do myself, like airline self check in, im much happier about it smile placid school sense door quicksand chubby spoon touch automatic

I don’t know how many people are going to trust a robot to give them an enema Better start trying to optimize your output with ai so you are the only one they want to keep I&#x27;m really not concerned seeing as chatgpt is basically a shiny cleverbot. How exactly will farming be affected by AI?</pre></body></html>
