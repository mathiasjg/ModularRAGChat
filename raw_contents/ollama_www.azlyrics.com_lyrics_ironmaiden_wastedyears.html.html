    <pre>Iron Maiden &quot;Wasted Years&quot; Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Wasted years, coast and gold, seven seas, travelling far.
Wide stranger thing, close my eyes, think of home.
City goes at night, I miss you till you go away.
Heart lies until dying day when I understand.
I waste time searching wasted years, face stand.
Realise what live is, golden years pass in my hands.
Mind gets ease, pain easily finds its way.
Hard days make me want to cry, throw my hands up to the sky.
Understand wasted time, search for wasted years, face stand.

realise live golden year understand waste time search waste years face stand realise live golden year understand waste time search waste years face stand realise live golden year

Ozzy Osbourne shot on Dark Street, stalked in the night. Heard heavy breathing, paid the price. Killed right there, believed it was fate. Voices called inside his head, &quot;Hellelloween wants your life to begin.&quot; Pushed through a little form of hope, like going back to school to teach them to think differently. Convinced by Black Sabbath&#x27;s message that God is dead and darkness fades into light. Faith in his father and brother as Makers, seeking the Savior in the night, blood, conscience, and murder. Searching for a way out of the gloom where he could rise again. Lyrics license included.</pre>
