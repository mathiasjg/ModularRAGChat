As tweeted by POE2's account which isn't allowed to be posted.

Dude was simply in a league of his own. no one else even came closeI like that this guy somehow made the odds of winning worse than they already were first time watching a race live, dude was crazy with it, was a fun watch Didnâ€™t expect him to look like an alternate universe Dr. Disrespect ðŸ˜‚ It's dissapointing that the big PoE1 racers didn't participate at all - especially those who were asking for racing content. There was a Maxroll podcast a little over a month ago where tyty and Havoc said they were dissapointed GGG wasn't doing races for PoE2, but then they do the races and neither of those guys joined in. Angormus is an elite gamer of the highest caliber.  Absolute stud at LoL top lane Nasus.  He's a great guy and congrats on the win friend! All warriors on leaders board. Massive nerf needed, +5 sec attack time for leap slam, fix animation cancel bug. it isn't easy being a xiaoge fan... Despairge I tried Angormus run yesterday. I quit after dying 10 times in act 1 and getting to the boss after 1 and half hours....

The dude is a monster, it makes it look easy. But dude, it's not. Why is PoE2's account not allowed to be posted in the PoE subreddit? Wtf? What I take from these races is how fucking crazy is it to have a MOVEMENT SPEED DEBUFF on some armors which are mechanically the most dogshit ones already. I know what Iâ€™m watching during work now! Banning Twitter links when GGG posts stuff like this there is so fucking dumb Interesting to see all these (relatively new/unknown) racers dominating PoE2 - good to keep things fresh! Watching angormus has taught me that my trash drops is a pure skill issue. isnâ€™t allowed to be postedâ€¦. LOL God gamer. -yawn- Congratulation bud ! I am soo happy for you ! all he does is win Ah yes, all 3 races...seems...
