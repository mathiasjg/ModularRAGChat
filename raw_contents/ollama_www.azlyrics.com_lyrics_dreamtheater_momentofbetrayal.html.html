Moment Betrayal lyric by Dream Theater:

Gabriel breaks the news,
Brave brother lies tonight.
Noise Machines threaten loss and fear.
Bloodshed, pain, and Ravenskill&#x27;s near.

Acting strange, on edge, voice changes.
Brotherâ€™s strength lost in the storm.

Arhys burns rise  
Secrets sell  
Moment betrayal  
Kiss death  
Blood revenge  
Moment betrayal  
Defenseless look fight witness hero tonight  
burns rise  
Secrets sell  
Moment betrayal  
Kiss death  
Blood revenge  
Moment betrayal  
Threats lie change side  
Moment betrayal risk  
Savior fall  
Moment betrayal

Megadeth &quot;Tout Le Monde Set Free&quot; remember to realize life is a game to be taken seriously, not ruled by a false idea whose cost is your very life. Look with eyes that find meaning in every passing moment. Epica &quot;Essence of Silence&quot; reveals the wrongness in corrupting strength; thoughts and moods can&#x27;t be controlled like the swing of a pendulum. Believe in the cold night&#x27;s stand, where the mind walks like a party gone dizzy. Search for lyrics under &quot;license&quot;.</pre>
