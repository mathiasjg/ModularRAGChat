IPO’d in Feb 2023 at $30/share.
Currently trading at just ~$3.70, down ~90% from IPO.

As of Q2 2025, it has reported $211.7M in cash/securities, which funds operations into 2027.

Gilead (based in Foster City, CA) is close to Kyverna’s headquarters in Emeryville, CA (~30 miles)

Everyone: I'm going to give you my opinion based on information I have obtained from the internet. I am not an insider, just an average Joe. KYTX is going to get bought out by Gilead Sciences. Once again, just my opinion. Gilead is just a short drive to KYTX, about 30 miles, maybe leading to cost cuts. Gilead along with Vida Ventures owns about 20% of KYTX. Vida Ventures has been involved with Gilead before helping Gilead buy another company and the Gilead board has some Vida Venture people on it. I believe both companies own KYTX at a much higher price than KYTX currently trades at. Novo Holdings owns about 5% of KYTX. Novo could make a play for KYTX but it would not go through. Insiders hold a nice amount of stock. Bain Capital is associated with Mitt Romney. I believe but not 100% sure that Bain Capital likes to sell companies and not run them. There is one other institutional holder that likes to sell companies also. Gilead has a good history of buying companies and this could add about 2% in value to Gilead (obviously KYTX has to hit on it's new drugs). The problem may be that KYTX may only be worth $15.00. Other insiders own KYTX higher so they are not going to happy. I own a lot at around $3.35. Just my opinion for what it's worth.

[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**⚔**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCave/) I have worked at Gilead. I have advised on business development initiatives at Gilead. And these are by far the dumbest reasons I have heard for why they would acquire the company. Maybe do a better due diligence and actually tell us what their clinical trials/pipeline look like lol Only 30 miles away? I’m all in I cannot imagine a weaker rationale for thinking a deal is coming than the two companies are both in the Bay Area.  Totally irrelevant in a biotech sale Here is my chatgpt:

KYTX — Due Diligence Synthesis

KYTX is a high-risk / high-reward biotech lottery ticket right now:
	•	It has serious institutional &amp; pharma backing, a strong catalyst calendar, and enough cash to deliver results without near-term financing pressure.
	•	But with no major data yet, it’s all binary bets on 2025–2026 readouts.

For a trader, KYTX looks like a catalyst swing stock (buy dips near $3.60–3.70, sell rips into resistance or into catalyst hype).
For a long-term speculator, this is a call option on CAR-T in autoimmune — you risk near-total loss if trials flop, but upside is 3–5× if data validates the platform

Strengths
	•	Cash runway into 2027 → ~$200M+ cash, debt-free, enough to fund through multiple readouts.
	•	Rich catalyst calendar (late 2025–2026) → MS &amp; RA IITs (Sep/Oct 2025), MG Phase 2 interim (Q4 2025), KYV-102 IND (Q4 2025), SPS registrational topline + BLA (H1 2026).
	•	Strategic partnerships → Gilead, Intellia, Oxford Biomedica, ElevateBio, Verily, Charité → strong external validation + de-risked manufacturing.
	•	Institutional backing → Vida Ventures, Bain, Novo, BlackRock, Vanguard, plus ~10% stake from Gilead → meaningful “smart money” presence.
	•	Potential first-mover advantage → Could become the first CAR-T approved in autoimmune disease (SPS in 2026).

⸻

Weaknesses / Risks
	•	No readouts yet → All catalysts are forward-looking; nothing validated clinically at scale.
	•	Rising cash burn → ~$75M in 6M 2025 vs. $49M prior year; raises dilution risk despite runway.
	•	Volatility → Weekly swings &gt;14%, underperforming biotech peers; moves heavily on sentiment.
	•	Execution risk → Scaling CAR-T for autoimmune is unproven compared to oncology.
	•	Insiders not buying → They hold large stakes, but no open-market insider buys in past year (only option grants). [deleted] I'm all in on Monday, you got me I can't trade the share on my platform in the UK. :-( Never trust big pharma bro Where do you go about finding these discounts? I feel like there are just too many companies to screen and I don’t know how to find the ones in industries or things I understand. **Proximity + shared VC ties = makes sense for a tuck-in acquisition.** *Down 90% from IPO and still someone sees 300% upside?*
