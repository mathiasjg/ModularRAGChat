    <pre>From the coast of gold across the seven seas

I&#x27;m travellin&#x27; on far and wide

But now it seems

I&#x27;m just a stranger to myself

And all the things I sometimes do

It isn&#x27;t me but someone else



I close my eyes, and think of home

Another city goes by in the night

Ain&#x27;t it funny how it is

You never miss it &#x27;til it&#x27;s gone away

And my heart is lying there

And will be &#x27;til my dying day



So understand

Don&#x27;t waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

Don&#x27;t waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you&#x27;re living in the golden years



Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind

Can&#x27;t ease this pain so easily

When you can&#x27;t find the words to say

It&#x27;s hard to make it through another day

And it makes me wanna cry

And throw my hands up to the sky



So understand

Don&#x27;t waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

Don&#x27;t waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you&#x27;re living in the golden years



So understand

Don&#x27;t waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you&#x27;re living in the golden years



So understand

Don&#x27;t waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you&#x27;re living in the golden years</pre>
