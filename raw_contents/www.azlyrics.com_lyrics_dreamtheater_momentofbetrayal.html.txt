[Gabriel:]

Brace yourself, my brother

I have breaking news

The Noise Machines lie still tonight

There's no time to lose



No more threats of bloodshed

No more pain and fear

Ravenskill will brave the storm

Our victory is near



You are acting very strange

Nervous and on edge

I will be a voice for change

Brother, give me strength




[Arhys:]

Burning rose

Secrets sold

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



I have sworn to live and die

Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



I have sworn to live and die

By the warrior's code

Never leave a man behind

May God redeem my soul



I will give you what you need

My brother for my son

Guilt and shame will burden me

Until my days are done



Meet me tonight where the stars touch the sky

He'll be alone there with nowhere to hide



Burning rose

Secrets sold

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



He will be defenseless

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



He will be defenseless

I'll look on

Say I put up a fight

There will be no witness

They will call you a hero tonight



Burning rose

Secrets sold

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



Threats and Lies

Changing sides

Moment of betrayal



Risking all

Savior's fall

Moment of betrayal
