# Summary

Feel like you missed out on winners, or were too scared to put in your Doordash check? **$SOFI** is literally the next big thing. Bears/bulls, value/growth, regards/chads- it fits every DD. I’m so sure I maxed out my entire life savings. Considering a line of credit on my mom’s house and a margin loan next.

This is NOT some SPAC bagholder trying to boost the stock price, nor is it a 0DTE cokehead move. This is a rational thesis for (I believe) a smart equity play. Did I see it go up a few cents, cream my pants, and think I’m the next Buffett writing this post? Maybe. In my opinion this is a 100% small penis 4-bagger and I’m sharing it like Moses with acid tabs.

Here’s the 4-point DD for you with ADHD:

* It’s Robinhood, but actually good for you
* The company is in great shape
* Permabears and bulls have reasons to love it
* The brand is (let me explain) the next JPMorgan Chase

# Thesis

**Product**

* SoFi is actually a great product. Is it the BEST? Fuck no. But it’s like the goldilocks/Anna Kendrick of all apps. The Friday night reliable.
* The company is going for this generation’s next big bank. It is high-interest, chartered (4.3% APY) and offers everything you need under the sun.
* The whole company’s theme is: “Get your money right.” They want to be the one-stop shop for all your MONEY needs and they do it with a bank teller smile.
* SoFi will ride or DIE with you. Student loan refi, your job’s direct deposit, a loan for that cock ring, a credit card for that solo trip to Thailand, a HELOC for that YOLO stock play. It goes on and on.
* They have consumers in mind, and not in a fake old lady See’s Candy kind of way. For example: if you lose your job and can’t pay your student debt, they will pause your payments and help you find a job. No joke. Look beyond the news and you’ll see people are over the moon about their relationship with SoFi.
* They have a few bad spots (dogshit trading platform and ETFs that never move), but they are trying so fucking hard. I could go on and on, but it’s 5:49am (couldn’t sleep, came up with this post in a fever dream) and I have a ton more to write.
* They also have Galileo and Technisys, which are like new PVC pipes for the financial system. I’m literally too smoothbrained to explain this, all you need to know is there is a lot of real interest from banks and companies to use these products. /r/sofistock has nerds who can explain this to you.

**Financials**

* Okay here comes the boring stuff, so skip this if you don’t care about amateur due diligence.
* Remember when banks used to pay good interest, then you realized they were pocketing it all? People are realizing and going to SoFi. When the bank crisis happened and everyone was moving their money out, SoFi actually GAINED deposits. The company has said they are on-track to add $2B each quarter, and management are known to low-ball their estimates. NINETY PERCENT of their customers use direct deposit for their premium membership SoFi Plus, which will only accelerate the trend. You know how hard it is to change banks with direct deposit. Sticky as shit.

h/t /u/SnipahShot for the graphic

* SoFi has EIGHT fucking quarters of consecutive revenue growth, is EBITDA profitable (whatever that’s worth to you), and is projected to be GAAP profitable by Q4. I think there’s an outside chance this happens in Q3. Dig into it more if you want to Burry it [https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc\_financials/2023/q1/Q1-23-Investor-Presentation\_.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Q1-23-Investor-Presentation_.pdf)
* SoFi is growing WHILE student loans have been paused. Name a better miracle. They replaced it by diversifying their business in financial services (e.g. the shit I mentioned earlier) and other loans.
* While most banks have been selling their loan books at a loss to manage higher interest rates, SoFi have been keeping theirs to maturity and getting a higher return. There is a lot of debate into this, especially around how they calculate mark to market, so again do your own DD about this.
* By the way: “there are many reasons insiders sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.” The CEO Anthony Noto is eating pork and beans like me buying the stock like CRAZY. I mean just look at this degeneracy. He knows he has a chance to become the next billionaire bank CEO Jamie Dimon and has purchased back $13.6m dollars worth of shares (1/5 of his total comp so far lmfao).

**Macro**

* Big picture time. Full disclosure, I’m a permabear. I literally have the worst outlook on things and I metaphorically killed my therapist with my doom and gloom. This country is so levered up to the tits it’s just one gentle breeze away from collapsing.
* But you know who always gets paid? By hook and crook, the banks will get what they’re owed. If not we are all fucked and/or there will be a bailout. If everything is going to shit, banks are the least dogshit shit. Would you rather buy a stock with a tremendous amount of debt super dependent on consumer spending, or something that will make money in a depression?
* I said this was a stock for everyone. For the permabulls, everything is fine and SoFi is growing its metrics like a rocket ship. What is there to lose? The management team has signaled good outlooks and the stock price has gone up consecutively since June 1st.
* For value investors, this stock is still near book value. Most bank stocks are, but considering its fair value by Morningstar ($16) or PT by well-known analysts ($8-12) there are still some mArGiN oF sAfEtY
* Growthies, this is a tech stock BABY. They are the AWS of finance! They use tech to analyze loan risk. They have AIAIAIAI in a chat bot! Upside everywhere
* Oh and by the way, $SOFI is not correlated with its peers. Look at $LC $UPST and other fintech companies in the sector. In my mind it’s becoming the Nubank of America.
* The Fed is expected to “skip” rate hikes next week. Long term that means APY is probably plateauing and on a downward trajectory. But if you know SoFi has done nothing but good and given you the best interest rate, why move?

**Brand**

* Okay let’s start with them suing the government for pausing student loans. The CEO has addressed this multiple times: they support student loan FORGIVENESS, but when it comes to PAUSING payments for borrowers who don’t qualify, they thought the 3rd year was excessive. Yes they shit the bed bad for that, but they’ll recover.
* Aside from the revenue, a big reason they did this is because the CEO has integrity. Like too much integrity to let this go for shareholders. Anthony Noto grew up working class, graduated from West Point, and rose through the ranks in the finance world. Imagine if Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was real and became a banking god.
* His track record is insane. CFO for the NFL during record growth. COO for Twitter where he was putting out garbage fires. He knows how to run shit, and now he’s back in finance after SoFi booted the last CEO for being pervy.
* One downside, he is boring as shit. He won’t talk about who’s a pedo, how Soros is evil or some other drama. He only talks about banking and banking accessories I tell you what. Bank Hill
* Look at his Twitter Likes. [https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/likes](https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/likes) He knows something is brewing, and he gets a big payday if the stock hits $45.
* Back to the company. At a recent fintech conference hosted by Piper Sandler, Noto announced that SoFi has a Net Promoter Score (how much people like the brand) of 80 for its loan business. For context, American Express has 52. The math says SoFi is literally 54% better.
* Maybe part of the reason is because they have the naming rights to a football stadium in Los Angeles. One where little kids go to see Taylor Swift and grown ass men watch other grown ass men smack into one another. Where it’s mentioned all the time for being state of the art and environmentally friendly in the largest entertainment market. WHERE THEY WILL HOST MULTIPLE WORLD CUP GAMES AND OLYMPIC SPORTS.
* I mentioned the SPAC bagholders. They still exist and have been pounding nonstop about the stock all the way down. There are some stonk flashbacks here that are about to explode.

# BUT BUT BUT…

* iTs pRiCeD iN – Wall Street is only getting a taste of this dildo. Once the annual shareholder meeting comes along next week and estimates come in better than expected on earnings, this next door 2 turns into a 10.
* Student loans defaults are coming, you stupid fuck – You think the bank will let you go to Disneyland once they start asking for their money? They will garnish wages and withhold taxes on you plebs. Grow up or move to Vietnam. Or, just maybe, the stock goes up and you use the profits to pay off the ball and chain?
* This is literally your first time posting to WSB – Yes, I’m a fucking worm lurking in the shadows. This will be the one and only thesis I put out.
* Wedbush has a PT of $3, this thing is going down – Go ahead and listen to David Chiaverini, who has a success rating of 35% and has no skin in the game [https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/david-chiaverini](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/david-chiaverini) Or me, who’s about to mortgage everything because he see’s asymmetric risk.
* Why post now? – I genuinely think this will get re-rated with a soft tech valuation of $32, and we’re at the cusp of it happening.
* What will change the price – Market realization, better than expected results coming soon, major deals announced, new product releases planned this year. Literally yesterday they announced “SoFi at Work”, a program to allow employers to help contribute to student loan payments.

# In Conclusion

Take this however you want, go fuck yourself etc. If you miss the boat, DM me to sign up for a new SoFi account and get up to $275 back when you set up direct deposit.

Again I cannot stress this enough, this is not financial advice and please do your own research.


*EDIT: Corrected some stats and added credit for deposit graphic.*Brilliant analysis, I&#x27;ll be sure to avoid this stock at all costs. Buying a stock pretty much at its 52 week high. I’m in. I’m in I hope I don’t have to commit suicide if your wrong on this Convincing my friend… however …. I’m not seeing near as many rocket emojis as I’d like to.. If you’re wrong on this I’m putting you on my suicide note Sadly I went balls deep on this stock at $15. 

Bag holder here Saw the ticker, Haven’t read anything, and I’m all in. In Op we trust Honestly, you’ll probably outperform the market. I’m up 50% on my shares. Sold half my calls to recoup my investment, now I’ve just got some $6 December calls that I’ll let ride. 

I’m a happy customer (HYSA use only), but I see the appeal. It’s a bank catering to upper middle class people in their 30s, and it does a good job of it. I don’t think the big banks hold the same appeal to my generation as they do to boomers. As all those old folks die off, SoFi will continue to see inflows. 

Also, I’d rather die than walk into a bank &amp;amp; talk to a teller, so the online only thing is a huge plus. Ok, you got me convinced. I&#x27;m selling puts on this one. Few corrections, SoFi doesn&#x27;t have 80 NPS, their home loan business has 80 NPS. SoFi doesn&#x27;t report NPS sadly but they have gained 7 NPS in 2021 and 7 NPS in 2022 (part of their exec team performance targets).

The Wedbush clown with his moronic failure of a report actually raised the PT from 2.5 to 3, about a week or 2 after cutting from 5 to 2.5, which was about 2 weeks after cutting from 7 to 5. I&#x27;d be damned if this clown didn&#x27;t get paid to make it drop so some institution gets in at 4.50 before this run up.

And I am glad someone found use for my deposits growth chart. I held this goddamned stock for two years and everytime it gained, it would immediately drop. I used sofi myself for a couple years (just the checking account) and it was fine but definitely has no proprietary or interesting angle over any other bank in the digital age. 

I just sold my position (about 20k stock) at a modest gain of a few hundred bucks during this latest pump (which makes zero logical sense given the loan pause was due to stop regardless of the debt ceiling deal).

So anyway all your DD is a bunch of nonsense but the fact that I sold is proof positive your yolo will pay handsomely. Where was this DD at $5 Idk much about Sofi, but I do know they have a pretty sick stadium in their name, ima buy shares next week I&#x27;ve been buying calls and selling them for 200%+ profit for the last 2 weeks. Too bad I&#x27;ve only been buying 1 or 2, so instead of early retirement, all I can afford is the early bird special. I made a good deal of money on sofi when I bought a ton of calls when it was like 4 bucks and it ran up over 5. Sold for a 60% gain. It could&#x27;ve been a massive win worthy wsb if I had yoloed the entire account and held till now. 

However that&#x27;s how you lose money. 

Sofi could very well still run up another dollar or two, but it&#x27;s currently pumping on student loans restarting. If for some reason the supreme court doesn&#x27;t block or even rule on bidens forgiveness plan which is entirely possible, sofi will drop 30% over night. Now, if you&#x27;re holding a fuck load of shares and wanna wait a good 2 years, I think you&#x27;ll make a ton of money. But I&#x27;m an options trader that wants money now, not later. Bank Hill My perfect stock is 3 parts beef 1 part chicken. $1.6Bn booked goodwill is sheer copium Sofi has been looking strong q after q even with no student loans damn I am in Love the conclusion &quot;go fuck yourself etc&quot; rofl SoFi is my top holding. I got in when it came out as a spac, sold it at $15 when the market took a crap and just got back in at $7. Going full kitty. I like the stock.

My other old spac stock is Matterport. I&#x27;ve been in since the beginning of the year. For me it was a student loan play and my options expire late July, whereas SCOTUS rules on that issue by the end of June. You can see the run-up already. People likely know the outcome of the case and nobody will get a dollar forgiven. More money for SoFi&#x27;s books. Great post. Sincerely. I think it&#x27;s wasted with this crowd. I&#x27;m out because I don&#x27;t like the sector but good luck, see you in the Lambo owners meeting. All in. SOFI is 60% of my holdings. Decent DD. I came up to nearly the same conclusions. Decided to pickup some calls next week. I’ve been on the fence for a small while, but your positions are wild. Been in since $12, not for much, but I’m holding. Won’t retire in it if it hits, but might take the family on a vacation. Many of my students really like SoFi. I hold it, but even given that, I&#x27;m hesitant to buy more. Im in Good DD. I like your writing style, although I am nowhere near as bullish on SOFI as you are. Hell, I&#x27;m 52 and can see the dollars on this stock. Having a $6.41 cost doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I might feel different if my cost was $15. As soon as nubank made an IPO in B3 their stocks fell to the floor. You picked a bad analogy OP.

But, fuck it. I have no wife nor her boyfriend to ask for permisssion That&#x27;s it! My meta gains are going all in on SoFi Bought 41 1/24 Calls in Jan. and up 86% and increasing. Holding for the big rally! Hold up. You can get a loan for a cock ring? I yolod 20K calls on this exp next week for the boys I was up 70% at some point today. Not selling. (It’s okay, it’s at 61%)

Didn’t read the whole post in true WSB fashion; but saw the 4 points. Excited to see this as a bag holder lol OP, this was a great analysis. I believe SoFI got a lot of potential and room to run so I love your thesis.

The only problem I’m having, like everyone else, is the 52 week high just being breached today. Yet again, the market can be regarded longer than you can be solvent lmao.

I love SoFI and I just exited for modest gains to focus on Adobe earnings this week. Damn it, you tryna pull me back in lol. I hold 1,000 shares of this in my IRA 4.52 avg.... selling CC weekly collecting premiums... I bank with them and love the free checks... just dont lose you debit card lol... savings account pays 4.3%... I have direct deposit

I&#x27;m thinking 5yr hold... 20PT once rates drop and they&#x27;re doing home refinancing again 👍

If you want to initiate a position sell puts I put whole 10$ Let&#x27;s trap sofi shorts and create a short squeeze So is the TLDR, Long calls dated for January/Feb? [deleted] I fucking love the new SoFi stadium in Inglewood! TL;DR. Fucking everyone SoFi is the next blue chip.

I’m in, and have been. Lambo with a $SOFI plate in my future. 2025 will be when it really breaks out.

Thanks y uncle Joe for depressing that asset with the student loan moratorium! It’s all rockets from here. 110k shares at 5$ average I’ve been in!  Let’s go Sofi is sofly Nice Doesn’t look like everything. You got some holding there blurred out. Funny, I asked Sven on YouTube about this stock.. he gave me the zoomed in head shake no.. lol tldr: Sofi is a *cool* bank</pre></body></html>
