[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) Completely uneducated blind gambling with retirement funds ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258) CVNA 120 puts for Jan 25'. How on earth did this company go from 4$ to 150$? Everyone's on NVDA calls. [deleted] selling LUNR after landing IM-2. Then going all in on RKLB for possible Neutron launch. If it plays out... MSOS. Just got hammered when the rescheduling got moved to Dec instead of Oct, good time to buy in.

Weed stocks arent intrinsically worth shit, even after legalization, but they are MASSIVELY reactionary to good weed news. Just keep buying in until federal recreational legalization is scheduled. Stocks will meteor before then, just sell most of your holding in the late run up for a decent return, then sell the rest IMMEDIATELY after the news for a potential massive return. They will inevitably crater within a few days of legalization when people realize there is a decade+ before they reach even their minimal potential as agricultural commodity stocks (not a high growth sector, historically, lol). But in the meantime, theres 10 bagger potential with this ETF. It peaked at 56ish i think during covid insanity, now around 7, with full legalization it could easily touch that 56 mark and even higher (very, very briefly. This is NOT a buy and hold) 8169 shares of NVDA @ $52 Polestar is at around one dollar and they just started manufacturing in US, just sayin'. SMCI calls Not a stock but a wild all in bet right now would be some soft commodities; Sugar, Wheat, Cotton to name a few are all beaten down to super lows. 

A semi-regarded case in the long run would be there Will ‚Äùalways be demand‚Äù for these + population growth + bad crops due to bad weather (if that Will be the case)= tighter supply = profit.

Thank me laterü´° [deleted] Siri Sofi 99c TLT December! If you're looking for a high-risk, high-reward play with Polestar (PSNY) in mind, here's a YOLO-worthy move:

**Play: LEAP Options on Polestar (PSNY)**

* **Strategy**: Buy deep out-of-the-money LEAP call options on PSNY, expiring in January 2026, with a low strike price (like $1). These options are already trading cheap, but if Polestar makes significant strides in the EV market, partners with a major player, or sees a sudden surge in popularity, these could turn into gold.
* **Why It Might Hit**: Polestar has potential as an EV underdog. If they can capture a slice of the booming EV market or if sentiment shifts favorably towards them (think new models, tech breakthroughs, or unexpected partnerships), the stock could skyrocket, and these calls could be worth a lot more.
* **Why It‚Äôs Risky**: Polestar is still an emerging player in a competitive space. If they fail to gain traction or if the broader market turns against growth stocks, these options could expire worthless.

This play is for those who are betting on the long-term success of Polestar in a big way, with a small initial investment that could pay off massively if everything goes right. It's definitely a YOLO move, but with a potential EV boom on the horizon, it might just pay off.

OR, Accumulate a significant number of Polestar (PSNY) shares while the price is still relatively low. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) Can‚Äôt say it here but you know I'm gonna buy the vix Got a heavy bag of Sauce coin. Definitely looking for a moon shoot this bull run when the decentralized exchanges get busy and Saucerswap starts processing more transactions. Sitting at about 4 cents right now but targeting for $2-3. üëΩüõ∏üìàüöÄ I saw a commercial for physical gold while watching fox and friends‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sitting on 900 shares of ass and tits praying I don‚Äôt end up in shambles this time. Also nvidia call lmao This person sounds like a journalist looking for a story Crowdstrike calls. Nvidia just bought into Crwd for nim, and no lawsuits in sight. Undervalued af 1. pull my entire port out of my down 60% AMC/GME position without waiting for the next pump  
2. put it all into MSTR, hell, put it into MSTX. Fuck it, buy MSTR calls Capri -&gt; YOLO (deal will go through) Its the skew, everyone is long and getting longer by the day and the market makers are trying to keep up and balanced. Betting directly on volatility! VIX (Cboe Volatility Index) it is! You guys will win or lose if it goes sharply up or down, I win both ways ü•∫ QQQ 483c expiring 9/3, basically this is a bet on NVDA since it should drive QQQ up with it hard on good earnings. All in in $deftf

I should be rewarded as a regard legend NVDA leveraged to the hilt lol I‚Äôm planning to buy Save stock. I feel the risks are overdone. The merger falling sucks but I feel it hurts JetBlue more than Spirit as JetBlue has to pay 69 mil to Spirit, and I believe they paid $400 mil to Spirit shareholders. Margins suck but as of the month they are adopting a new revenue strategy of bundling benefits and the premium bundles are a pretty good deal to compete with bigger airline budget economy bundles and appeal to a variety of customers. The debt that they hold that is coming due soon that‚Äôs worth   1.11 billion and 1.033 billion can be worked around through selling the 2 billion dollarish amounts they have in planes and then leasing them back. They also hold 1.4 billion in current assets. I put 500 in clover awhile back, got my money back already and just letting it ride.

In general I just buy on big dips so Amazon nvidia msft 

Maybe sofi, I think they are bound to pop with recent earnings being good UPST!!! I'm short volatility post NVDA earnings. Market always panics beforehand and then Nvidia jumps. Even if earnings aren't good, New information may dampen nerves/volatility. Calls on VIX. All in on Doge coin








Not really $CURLF UPST [removed] Craziest? Spxl
But I‚Äôm emotionally bearish so today on nvda earnings I‚Äôm doing calls and puts cause I think it‚Äôll move one way or another significantly by end of day tomorrow, I‚Äôm envisioning one last pump when rates cut more than priced in and then we all die üòÇ except for bears; our hatred keeps us alive Want to bet the house on some OTM NVDA calls.. but already bet it &amp; nothing left.. so robinpoo.com literally bullying me out of my trades üòÇ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225) RILY looks ready to explode after good news I wanted to buy 250 contracts CHWY 26 8/30 exp and the about 100k in CHWY stock but Reddit said I would lose ü•≤ Live person aka LSPN future is bright Short bonds via tlt puts betting on a return to $90 Buy when QQQ drops 10% Bought around $20k of ASTS at ~$31.50 after it went from like 29 to 37 to 31 over the course ot 10 minutes ish, then sold it at $35 ish 3 hrs later or something. I'm not holding that stock for shit but done a lot of &lt;5 hr trades with it.¬† Crypto. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) otm tqqq puts for december No
