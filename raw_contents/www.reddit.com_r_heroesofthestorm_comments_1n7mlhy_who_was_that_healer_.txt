There was this Warcraft healer I fought against but can't remember who he was. I think he's a human character and is very close to the king. Obsessed with The Light. He was at level 20 and had his talents applied, so maybe some of the following doesn't always apply without said talents.

His Q makes a flash of light that heals one ally and himself. It was a point and click.

The W shoots out a beam of light that harms enemies and heals all allies that are hit by it (it's guaranteed to always hit him at least).

His E CCs one enemy so that everyone gangs up and attacks the CCed enemy that can't move.

His ult makes him grant invulnerable to allies (but I don't think he gave it to himself). 

His other ult makes a circle that stuns any enemy heroes that get hit within the circle's effects.

Anyone know what that guy's name is?Anduin Gul'dan? Definitely reghar Repost. It’s either Uthuin or Anduther. I’m not sure. Twin blades varian Repost drugs are bad m'kay
