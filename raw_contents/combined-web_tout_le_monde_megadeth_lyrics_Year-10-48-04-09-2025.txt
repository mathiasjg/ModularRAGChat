You take a mortal man

And put him in control

Watch him become a god

Watch people's heads a-roll

A-roll, A-roll



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction



Acting like a robot

Its metal brain corrodes

You try to take its pulse

Before the head explodes

Explodes, Explodes



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony

Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction



The earth starts to rumble

World powers fall

A-warring for the heavens

A peaceful man stands tall

A-tall, A-tall



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

Being round you is driving me crazy

Watching you run is making me lazy

You're trying to buy a place in my head

Telling me lines I've already read

Speaking my name to try to confuse me

Say it again you're starting to lose me



That's alright I'm okay

It happens every single day

It's all the same

But I'm not blind



It's all about you not me

It's all about the things

That you're expecting me to be

There's not enough time to live

And all that you're expecting me to give

There's not enough time to live

And all that you're expecting me to give



It's all about you not me

It's all about you not me



You're building my prison brick by brick

Eating your words is making me sick

You get what you want

Cause nothing is sacred

You're reading my mind

And leaving me naked

You say I gotta give before I receive it

One of these days I'll believe it



It's all about you not me

It's all about the things

That you're expecting me to be

It's all about you not me

It's all about the things

That you're expecting me to be

There's not enough time to live

And all that you're expecting me to give



It's all about you not me

It's all about you not me

Don't remember where I was

I realized life was a game

The more seriously I took things

The harder the rules became

I had no idea what it'd cost

My life passed before my eyes

When I found out how little I accomplished

All my plans denied



So as you read this know my friends

I'd love to stay with you all

Please smile when you think of me

My body's gone that's all



Ã tout le monde 
[To all the world]

Ã tout mes amis 
[To all my friends]

Je vous aime 
[I love you]

Ã tout mes amis 
[To all my friends]

Je vous aime 
[I love you]

Je dois partir 
[I have to leave]

These are the last words

I'll ever speak

And they'll set me free



If my heart was still alive

I know it would surely break

And my memories left with you

There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing

What it leaves behind is hard

You know the sleeping feel no more pain

And the living are scarred



Ã tout le monde

(I don't want to set the world on fire...)



Red flash, clouds choking out the morning sky

They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie

All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb

Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun



Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999

Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines

Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face

No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late

No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late



The arsenal of megadeath can't be rid they said

And if it comes, the living will envy the dead

Racing for power, and all come in last

No winning, first stone cast

This falsehood, worldly peace

Its treaties soon will cease



No one will be left to prove that humans existed

Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted

We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke



Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy

Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy

And now the final scene, a global darkening



Dig deep, piles of rubble and ruins

Towering overhead both far and wide

There's unknown tools for World War III

Einstein said "We'll use rocks on the other side."

No survivors!



Set the world afire!



No survivors, set the world afire!

From the coast of gold across the seven seas

I'm travellin' on far and wide

But now it seems

I'm just a stranger to myself

And all the things I sometimes do

It isn't me but someone else



I close my eyes, and think of home

Another city goes by in the night

Ain't it funny how it is

You never miss it 'til it's gone away

And my heart is lying there

And will be 'til my dying day



So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years



Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind

Can't ease this pain so easily

When you can't find the words to say

It's hard to make it through another day

And it makes me wanna cry

And throw my hands up to the sky



So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years



So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years



So understand

Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

Face up... make your stand

And realise you're living in the golden years

[Gabriel:]

Brace yourself, my brother

I have breaking news

The Noise Machines lie still tonight

There's no time to lose



No more threats of bloodshed

No more pain and fear

Ravenskill will brave the storm

Our victory is near



You are acting very strange

Nervous and on edge

I will be a voice for change

Brother, give me strength




[Arhys:]

Burning rose

Secrets sold

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



I have sworn to live and die

Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



I have sworn to live and die

By the warrior's code

Never leave a man behind

May God redeem my soul



I will give you what you need

My brother for my son

Guilt and shame will burden me

Until my days are done



Meet me tonight where the stars touch the sky

He'll be alone there with nowhere to hide



Burning rose

Secrets sold

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



He will be defenseless

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



He will be defenseless

I'll look on

Say I put up a fight

There will be no witness

They will call you a hero tonight



Burning rose

Secrets sold

Moment of betrayal



Kiss of death

Blood revenge

Moment of betrayal



Threats and Lies

Changing sides

Moment of betrayal



Risking all

Savior's fall

Moment of betrayal

I'm ahead, I'm a man

I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah

I'm at peace with my lust

I can kill cause in God I trust, yeah

It's evolution, baby



I'm at peace, I'm the man

Buying stocks on the day of the crash

On the loose, I'm a truck

All the rolling hills, I'll flatten 'em out, yeah

It's herd behavior, uh huh

It's evolution, baby



Admire me, admire my home

Admire my son, he's my clone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This land is mine, this land is free

Admire my son, he's my clone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This land is mine, this land is free

I'll do what I want but irresponsibly

It's evolution, baby



I'm a thief, I'm a liar

There's my church, I sing in the choir:

(Hallelujah, hallelujah)



Admire me, admire my home

Admire my son, admire my clones

'Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast

Those ignorant Indians got nothing on me

Nothing, why? Because

It's evolution, baby



I am ahead, I am advanced

Nothing, why? Because

It's evolution, baby



I am ahead, I am advanced

I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah

I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher

2010, watch it go to fire

It's evolution, baby

It's evolution, baby



Do the evolution

Come on

Come on, come on
