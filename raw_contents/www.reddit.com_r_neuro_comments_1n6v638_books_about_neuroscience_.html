So I want books that encompasses subjects I mentioned without over explanation. And if it&#x27;s discussing it from developing AI pov it well be amazing. I have asked GPT/Gemini and it suggested me some books that I start reading, but hearing personal people experiences will be way better.“Behave” by Robert sapolsky is where I started. Also his entire Stanford course on human behavioral biology is on YouTube. Highly recommend. What’s your background OP? How further along are you in your education and which field have you gained your education in? The recommendations would vary quite a bit depending on your mathematical background and field of study, since computational neuroscience spans everything from accessible overviews to quite technical mathematical treatments. A must read for anyone interested in neuroscience is - The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons by Sam Kean

It goes through the hallmark stories of neuroscience. Not heady, but stories you&#x27;d never know otherwise that paint the history and landscape of modern neuroscience. Highly recommend! In Search of Memory by Eric Kandel, probably the greatest living neuroscientist, tells his life story but with a heavy research emphasis, i.e. here is what we knew about the brain when I started and here is what we know now. It&#x27;s a good introductory read to slowly pick up some neuroscience in an entertaining narrative Absolutely mind boggling neuro

https://unteachablecourses.com/neurozoology/ One foundational book I think you might enjoy is Godel Escher Bach by Doug Hofstadter.   
Don&#x27;t let the size intimidate you, it is playful and fun and many sections are quick reads. However, he does take the reader into pretty deep territory with regards to formal systems and math. Those don&#x27;t come out of no where though, Doug is a terrific guide for the uninitiated reader and you will come out the other end having learned a lot about a lot including a very sound argument for where the sense of &quot;I&quot; comes from. I have a background in psychology, and I just decided to start with these:

‌Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience by Thomas P. Trappenberg, Third Ed.

‌Neuronal Dynamics: From Single Neurons to Networks and Models of Cognition by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud, and Liam Paninski.

‌Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting by Eugene M. Izhikevich

And this one for fun  because I like insects:
‌Invertebrate Learning and Memory (Handbooks of Behavioral Neuroscience, Volume 22), edited by Randolf Menzel and Paul R. Benjamin, series editor Joseph P. Huston. Anything credible but Robert Sapolsky</pre></body></html>
