I think he&#x27;s a human character and is very close to the king. Obsessed with The Light. He was at level 20 and had his talents applied, so maybe some of the following doesn&#x27;t always apply without said talents.

His Q makes a flash of light that heals one ally and himself. It was a point and click.

The W shoots out a beam of light that harms enemies and heals all allies that are hit by it (it&#x27;s guaranteed to always hit him at least).

His E CCs one enemy so that everyone gangs up and attacks the CCed enemy that can&#x27;t move.

His ult makes him grant invulnerable to allies (but I don&#x27;t think he gave it to himself). 

His other ult makes a circle that stuns any enemy heroes that get hit within the circle&#x27;s effects.

Anyone know what that guy&#x27;s name is?Anduin Gul&#x27;dan? Definitely reghar Repost. It’s either Uthuin or Anduther. I’m not sure. Twin blades varian Repost drugs are bad m&#x27;kay</pre></body></html>
