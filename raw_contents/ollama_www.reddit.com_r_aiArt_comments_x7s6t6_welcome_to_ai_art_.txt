\-MOD TeamI use
 to do general art work, paintings. Drawing, cad work, architecture work, I had a friend that was telling me he did ai work and He explained it to me, sent me his link, explained prompts, each, eniegn, the seed, the list goes on, so then I got the hang of it.

Now, I prefer AI over my basic art cause to ne its more relaxing, it makes me clear my head, When I'm in platforms and I see someone's art I try to figure out how they did it with out using their prompts, it envigeraying, fun, enjoyable, helps me relax, clear my mind, and challenging to me. I'm actually glad that I was introduced to AI. After 15 years of old style art that drove me nuts of only being able to get 1 varation, I can now get 4. [removed] I've been having a blast turning photos of me into anime with ai mirror I’ve been trying to sort out editing my flair (using official Reddit app on iOS), but can’t figure it out. 

Using Bing Image Creator and it isn’t on the list. 

Is this function not available through the app? [removed] [removed] [removed] I feel stupid, but... how do I contact the moderators?  
I've done a comicbook on youtube using mid/niji but I'm worring that posting it would be considered self-promotion. [removed] [deleted] [removed] [removed] [removed] Is there somewhere that I can ask about the relative merits of the the particular software etc because I'd really like to start using this from my work as kind inspiration points for my creative writing students etc I can literally create scenarios that I want to explore but some of the high-end costings a slightly worrying so I'd like to talk about Wonder etc which it's £20 lifetime membership seems much more more durable if that makes sense I can't seem to open a general post yet so I thought I'd ask here apologies if it's the wrong place pls give me links to free ai art generator
