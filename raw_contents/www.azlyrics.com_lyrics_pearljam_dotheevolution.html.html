I&#x27;m ahead, I&#x27;m a man

I&#x27;m the first mammal to wear pants, yeah

I&#x27;m at peace with my lust

I can kill cause in God I trust, yeah

It&#x27;s evolution, baby



I&#x27;m at peace, I&#x27;m the man

Buying stocks on the day of the crash

On the loose, I&#x27;m a truck

All the rolling hills, I&#x27;ll flatten &#x27;em out, yeah

It&#x27;s herd behavior, uh huh

It&#x27;s evolution, baby



Admire me, admire my home

Admire my son, he&#x27;s my clone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This land is mine, this land is free

Admire my son, he&#x27;s my clone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This land is mine, this land is free

I&#x27;ll do what I want but irresponsibly

It&#x27;s evolution, baby



I&#x27;m a thief, I&#x27;m a liar

There&#x27;s my church, I sing in the choir:

(Hallelujah, hallelujah)



Admire me, admire my home

Admire my son, admire my clones

&#x27;Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast

Those ignorant Indians got nothing on me

Nothing, why? Because

It&#x27;s evolution, baby



I am ahead, I am advanced

Nothing, why? Because

It&#x27;s evolution, baby



I am ahead, I am advanced

I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah

I crawled the earth, but now I&#x27;m higher

2010, watch it go to fire

It&#x27;s evolution, baby

It&#x27;s evolution, baby



Do the evolution

Come on

Come on, come on</pre>
