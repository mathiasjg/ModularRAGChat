Symphony of Destruction lyrics by Megadeth:  
Mortal man control, watch god, watch people head roll, roll, roll like Pied Piper led rat street dance like marionette sway.  
Symphony of Destruction, act like robot, metal brain corrode, try to pulse, head explode, explodes.  
Explodes like Pied Piper led rat street dance like marionette sway.  
Symphony Swaying: Symphony of Destruction, earth start rumble, world power fall, war heaven peaceful man stand tall, tall, tall like Pied Piper led rat street dance like marionette sway.  
Symphony Swaying: Symphony of Destruction
