Those gloves would be ridiculously OP but what is more likely is that either:

\-because life doesnt change, you dont receive the 2nd part of the effect since the first condition never went through  
\-You gain 0 energy shield since life didnt change at all and remained the same so nothing was &quot;sacrificed&quot; You&#x27;re going to use Archmage while relying on mana regeneration based on life, and at the same time, you&#x27;re cutting off 50% of your life to ES with Ghostwrithe. This means you&#x27;ll need significantly more investemnt in life than mana to get enough mana regeneration, which makes the entire Archmage setup (likely to be numerically nerfed as well) not worth your 100 Spirit. you know what. imma try this I&#x27;m curious if the Jewel stacking plus adorned will be enough to carry for damage outside of the archmage. Might be decent mapper/ breach farm though as if it works should be a tank. Oh how I missed paint build posts!! I got the gloves at lvl 19 with 33% all elements. Nice one my lightning merc https://preview.redd.it/t91m70iohtre1.png?width=340&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4541a38bfe2c8f7c15782d93d624aa58204e4ccb

how good will this be for eternal life build I’m really keen on Lich but I want to see buffs to chaos spells then I’m all in For the curses to do damage do we just go Decaying Hex and stack Int since we&#x27;re stacking mana anyways? I&#x27;m not familiar with the numbers in POE 2 so would like 1k int (so 600dps from Decay) be enough damage?? Paint builds are some of the best content we get lol. Always love to see people‘s crazy ideas near league start [removed] Paint builds are a requirement as proof you are a Path of Exile player. This one lacks the required amount of memes. No cooking before patch notes. Especially after &quot;Forget everything you thought you knew&quot;.

It&#x27;s also been kind of funny to watch YouTubers release guides for act layouts, when we&#x27;ve been told explicitly that content in the acts will change between updates. Did they do that this time???? I think it&#x27;s more likely than not! chest and helmet will be nerfed. guys everything will be nerfed wait for patch notes. In what way, shape or form is this a paint build? What isn&#x27;t sacrificed isn&#x27;t used, so I don&#x27;t expect Demon Stitcher to work. Archmage + conduit might be problematic to do at the same time. Too much mana drain, + we can&#x27;t spec into the chaos and lightning at the same time. Devs already confirmed that you can not use life tap or anything related to life with that node. It counts as 0 life when you have ES. Wait for the patch notes. Archmage, es will be dead with 99% precision Mana/life to es conversion is getting nerfed 100%. So is archmage. That&#x27;s your whole build doa once the patch notes drop. I too watched the ruetoo video</pre></body></html>
