Avenged Sevenfold lyrics: M.
Stare carnage, pray for sun rise,
Live each day, disguise feeling right.
Lend me courage to stand and fight tonight.
Ooooo, stand and fight against raging challenges.
Strong in our walk, find our land and belong.
Millions of soldiers, fighting the wrong, seeking fun far from home.
Fight war, find our way, picture what we want well.
Scared of killing, but seek fun and shoot for what is right.
Mother, son, erase consciousness, dream of honor.
Fight for life, pray to God, right or wrong.
Win or lose, let home fill with mother's tears.
Grow fast in years, memories will let us cry return tonight.

Soldier life: Scared alive by murder; know and tell reasons for fighting; weapon in hand; fear consumes every day. Life is real fight; honor binds it all together. Pray to God for right path; hope to win but accept loss; yearn for home and mother. Tears fill eyes, yet they grow fast; memories let one cry tonight as they stare at carnage. Pray that the sun rises, live another day, even if it is a disguise of feeling right. Lend me courage to stand and fight; watch death toll rise but wonder how I am still alive among strangers' blood on my hands. Shot by shot, night turns silent; watch brother die, plan for tomorrow's carnage, thoughts swirling in endless loops. Ohhhhh.
