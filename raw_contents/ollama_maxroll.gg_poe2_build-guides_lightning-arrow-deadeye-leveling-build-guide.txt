Important Leveling Tips:
- Early Access: Lightning Arrow, Deadeye

Leveling Build: With experience, the Leveling Progression outlined above is all you need.

However, if you're looking for additional guidance, then review the Important Leveling Tips listed below and the Path of Exile 2 Campaign Walkthrough.

General Progression Tips

- **Bow & Quiver Progression**

  - **Level 2 Crude Bow**: This is your starting bow! In most scenarios, it's not worth crafting.
  
  - **Level 5 Shortbow (Optional)**: Optional item for early game versatility.
  
  - **Level 11 Warden Bow**: Any Magic or Rare Warden Bow with Increased Physical Damage or Flat Elemental Damage. Socket with 1 to 2 Lesser Elemental Runes.
    - **Item Level:** 11 to 13, for the next tier of Flat Elemental Damage to Attacks modifiers.
  
  - **Level 28 Dualstring Bow**: Any Magic or Rare Dualstring Bow with Increased Physical Damage or Flat Elemental Damage. Socket with 1 to 2 Lesser Elemental Runes or Elemental Runes. Consider using a Blacksmith's Whetstone(s) to increase the item quality by 20%.
    - **Item Level:** 28 to 31, for the next tier of Flat Elemental Damage to Attacks or Physical Damage modifiers.
    - **Item Level:** 33 to 36, for the subsequent tier of Flat Elemental Damage to Attacks or Physical Damage modifiers.

Level 54 Twin Bow:
- Any Magic or Rare Twin Bow with Increased Physical Damage or Flat Elemental Damage Socket with 2 Elemental Runes or Greater Elemental Runes.
- Consider using Blacksmith's Whetstone(s) to increase Quality by 20% for the Item.
- Item Level: 62 to 65+ for the next tier of Flat Elemental to Attacks or Physical Damage modifiers.

Level 78 Gemini Bow:
- Any Magic or Rare Gemini Bow with Increased Physical Damage or Flat Elemental Damage Socket with 2 Greater Elemental Runes.
- Consider using Blacksmith's Whetstone(s) to increase Quality by 20% for the Item.
- Item Level: 81+ for the next tier of Flat Elemental to Attacks modifiers.
- Item Level: 82+ for the next tier of Physical Damage modifiers.

Listed above are the ideal Bow base breakpoints. Note that at Level 28 and higher, Bows that provide "Bow Attacks fire an Additional Arrow" are prioritized. That said, the general rule of thumb is to equip the Bow that provides the most DPS. This is also true for quivers.

Flat Elemental Damage to Attacks:
During the early game, acquiring Flat Elemental Damage to Attacks on as many gear pieces as possible is extremely important to efficiently scale your damage.

Flat Elemental Damage to Attacks can roll on the following slots, listed in priority: Bows - The largest source of Flat Elemental Damage, Quivers - The second largest source of Flat Elemental Damage, Rings, Gloves, Artificer's Orbs, and the Salvage Bench.

In addition to rolling Flat Elemental Damage to Attacks on items, Artificer's Orb can be used on your weapons, allowing you to socket Runes for more damage. For efficient early game damage scaling, elemental runes are recommended: Lesser Storm Rune, Lesser Glacial Rune, Lesser Desert Rune, Storm Rune, Glacial Rune, Desert Rune.

As you progress through the campaign and further into endgame, the base physical damage of Bows increases. Therefore, on certain Magic or Rare items, it may be optimal to socket an Increased Physical Damage Rune: Lesser Iron Rune, Iron Rune, Greater Iron Rune.

Artificer's Orbs can be found or generated as follows: Random drops from killing monsters, Secrets, or from salvaging socketed items for Artificer's Shard with the Salvage Bench; unlocked from returning Renly's Smithing Tools to Renly in Act 1.

The Salvage Bench can also be used on Superior Items (Items with Quality) to generate Blacksmith's Whetstones.

Crafting Items:
- Disenchanting & Exalt Slamming: If you find a 1 or 2 Mod Magic Item with desirable mods, consider using a Regal Orb. Regals can be a somewhat rare drop but can be deterministically generated by Disenchanting Rare Items for Regal Shards.
- A Disenchant Vendor, usually the Potion Seller, can be found in each town.

Note: You do not receive Gold for disenchanting items; you may prefer to vendor Rare Items instead for Gold.

If you hit a desirable modifier with your Regal Orb, consider using an Exalted Orb to add more modifiers. It's worth noting that in some trade league scenarios, it might be technically better to save your Exalted Orbs and purchase upgrades via trade.

Vendor Checks & Gambling:
When it comes to Vendors, you have two main options: Purchasing Pre-Rolled Items or Gambling for a Random Item. Both options cost Gold, and one strategy is not necessarily better than the other.
- Typically, players check Vendors for a guaranteed upgrade or Gamble if they have gold to spare to potentially acquire an above-average item.

Reforging Bench After defeating Mektul, the Forgemaster, you unlock the Reforging Bench; which allows you to combine 3 Magic Items or 3 Rare Items into 1 Random Magic or Rare Item. Consider saving "failed crafts," poorly rolled drops, or vendor items if you plan to use this strategy.

Farm Zones, Levels & Uncut Skill Gems In Path of Exile 2, most skills increase their damage with gem levels. If you're having trouble with a certain boss fight, consider farming an earlier zone for extra character levels, gear, and Uncut Skill Gems. For example, if you're struggling with Jamanra, the Risen King, farm the Dreadnought Vanguard until Level 31 while also looting Level 9 Uncut Skill Gems.

Note: Plan your passive tree accordingly as skill gems can occasionally have very steep attribute requirements.

Skill Rotation Early Access Lightning Arrow Deadeye Leveling Build Clear During the run, the majority of your pack-to-pack clear is done with Lightning Arrow, and secondarily with Freezing Salvo. You can use Lightning Rod & Lightning Arrow while clearing if the playstyle is preferable.

Furthermore, after equipping Herald of Thunder, your clearing ability significantly increases; allowing you to use either Lightning Rod or Lightning Arrow to proc Herald of Thunder Explosions.

**Basic Single Target (Levels 2-13):**
From Level 2 to Level 13, the basic combo is to spam Lightning Rod and shoot into it with Lightning Arrow. Ensure the target stays within the Lightning Rod AoE explosions to maximize single-target damage.

**Advanced Single Target (Level 14+ vs Tankier Monsters):**
At Level 14+, use Barrage before shooting Lightning Arrow for increased single-target damage.
- At Level 14+, use Freezing Salvo at 12 Missile Stacks for additional single-target damage and to freeze the enemy.

**Advanced Single Target (Levels 22+):**
At Level 22+, follow the combo listed above and activate Voltaic Mark as the target becomes more vulnerable, before attacking with the rest of your skills.
- At Level 41+, follow the same combo and activate Tornado Shot before fighting the enemy to build Rage. Recast Tornado Shot during longer fights, slightly before its expiration, to maintain Rage stacks.

FAQ Early Access Lightning Arrow Deadeye Leveling Build

Does the run acquire all Passive Skill Points & Permanent Stats?
- Yes.

What rewards did you choose from the Relics in Act 2 and Venom Drought in Act 3?
- Relic: 15% increased Mana Recovery from Flasks.
- Venom Drought: 25% increased Stun Threshold.

How do I do more Damage?
- As the run progresses, it's important to continuously upgrade your gear, prioritizing your Bow, Quiver, Gloves, and Rings. A High Physical Damage or Elemental Damage Bow is the most impactful item slot that affects your damage, ideally found on a Dualstring Bow, Twin Bow, or Gemini Bow base.
- Quivers are the second most impactful item slot; they can provide Increased Projectile Speed paired with Feathered Fletching, and can be further scaled with nodes such as Master Fletching.
- Gloves and Rings are roughly equal in value as the third damage scaling slot. Aim for lots of Flat Physical or Elemental Damage to Attacks on these items.

How do I die less?
- Lightning Arrow Deadeye is played with a kill or be killed playstyle.

Aggressive play is required to freeze and destroy enemies before they can attack. When facing bosses, stunning or freezing them is crucial to keep them within the Lightning Rod's explosion radius. If aggressive play is challenging, avoid dodging into enemies; instead, clear any enemies ahead of you before progressing.

Additionally:

- Regularly upgrade your item bases for more base stats (Evasion & Energy Shield).
- Increase your Elemental Resistance.
- Boost your Life Pool through gear or character levels.
- Enhance your defensive layers by increasing Evasion Rating and Deflection.
- Wear the appropriate charm: 
  - Resist Charms for Elemental Damage
  - Amethyst Charm for Chaos Damage
  - Stone Charm for Stuns
  - Thawing Charm for Freeze
