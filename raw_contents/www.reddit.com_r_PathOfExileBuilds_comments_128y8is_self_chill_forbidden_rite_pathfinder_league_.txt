(DEV UPDATE for the new tree).

Requeriments: The Golden Rule, Icefang Orbit and Winterweave Ring for self chill, but you can play without it!

This is just a starting template, there is a lot of options to consider like Corrupted Soul with Eldritch Battery and MoM (Skin of The lords) or Divine Flesh.This is a starting build that can have TONS of upgrades late game, included the new busted amulet that heals you instead with your self poison... but I think that we can start the build even without it, using the new Protection Mastery that you can't be inflicted a new damaging effect when you already have, so you will have only 1 stance of self poison, and 1 of self chill.. AND WILL BE IMMUNE TO ALL OTHER AILMENTS!

&amp;#x200B;

* 8.5-10M dps on day 2 or 3...
* with no clusters, no alternate quality, no other mandatory uniques.
* Ailment immune.
* Self chill and 140%+ movement speed.
* 79% elem Resistances (with apep's Slumber shield, but it is not requiered for start).
* 84% Chaos resistance with Divine Flesh and Apep's.
*Shakari pantheon for max 3 poisons if protection mastery doesn't cap the max poison at 1.
* Possible to get 100% spell supression.
* Eldritch Battery and Divine Blessing (Using Haste) - Use Replica Sorrow of Divine, but you can path directly to Eldritch Battery while you don't have it.
* If you want more Tankyness, maybe Using Sorrow of The Divine (no replica) and Corrupted Soul (Split damage between ES and Life).
* Petrified Blood Tech with the new Master Surgeon.
*Crit immune from poison mastery.

&amp;#x200B;

Forbidden Rite AND Self Poison is mitigated by the new Master Surgeon PLUS Doppelganger Guise, but I think that even without Doppelganger Guise you can sustain both with 84% chaos resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

Startint Upgrades path.

* The new Tainted Pact Amulet.
* Split ES and Life damage as long you can sustain FR mana cost or use MOM.
* Frenzy/Affliction charges.
* Endurance Charges.
* Clusters with septic spells or Alternate Herald of Agony and drop chance to poison support.
* &amp;#x200B;


Edit. I just put a few clusters and the dps jumped to 24M.
This gonna be OP. Reddit
...

I was thinking about starting SST Poison or Shield Crush Poison with Obliteration, but i could only get about 3M dps with starter gear, while this look more tanky and 3x more damage.The new amulet is kinda redundant with PF recovery...I think amulet is best utilized by another ascendancy like occultist

Im interested in exploring hit-based FR with RF running, with maybe poison as auxiliary way to proc self-chill Regarding ice fang self chill, it's only 10% and needs to be scaled with chill effect/elemental ailment effect. I don't know if you thought of that since i didn't have time to check your pob yet.

Regarding the new amulet, Pathfinder doesn't really have a problem with sustain, either through the new mastery recover 4%of life on flask use, or the ascendancy life flask.

The ailment immune tec is cool thanks for that ! That mastery actually pretty busted for self-chill and poison, good catch. Ok gonna copy here what I posted elsewhere. I would be very wary of running that mastery in a self ailment build.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So word of warning using this mastery for things like self-chill. It should prevent all additional self-chilling while you are chilled.  
&gt;  
&gt;Normally you have no downtime because you are constantly inflicting chills with overlapping durations but this should prevent you from self-chilling again until after the first chill wears off. That mandates a (very brief) period of downtime where you are not actually ailment immune and if you were to pick up another ailment during that time it would lock out your self-chill.  
&gt;  
&gt;The consequences of this will vary from minor to crippling depending on your particular build. The biggest pain point will probably be ground effects, running a shocked ground map basically guarantees that you will be shocked before you can refresh your chill. [deleted] Man, this looks amazing in theory.

I was worried the self-poisoning couldn't be overcome due to how much damage the character dealt, but then I remember Soul of Shakari pantheon. With that, we only have 3 stacks of poison, plus all the chaos mitigation the build has, I think it's wouldn't matter at all.

I might give this a try. The protection mastery is absolutely BUSTED.

Great job! Some things to look into : 

\- Your chaos res is depending too much on your amethyst flask which has only 72% uptime. It's fine during mapping because you'll kill monsters, might be problematic during bossing. 

\- Same for EB, your replica sorrow has only 70% uptime

\- Chance to poison support. Get rid of it. You can change the poison and cast speed on serpentine spellslinger wheel to the poison chance, which leave you at 95% chance to poison (it's fine). And you can put void manipulation as your 6th support gem (more damage)

\- mana / ES sustain : you have way too little regen to sustain forbidden rite spamming. 200 mana per second against 80 ES regen, you'll be oom way too fast.  To get around a little, take the life mastery "skill cost life instead of 30% mana cost". It basically get you down to 110 mana cost per second. Add boot enchant and you're at 50 mana cost per second. it's fine during replica sorrow uptime but you won't have mana during that 30% downtime.

\- Life sustain : You have 683 life regen from your life flasks + 400 life regen from dopple. That approx 1100 life regen per second. You hit yourself for 156 life per hit, you hit yourself 6 times a second approx that's 936 life per second if you spam. That leaves you with a little bit of extra regen but not much, be careful with that. (For some reason you have a life cost on FB and I don't understand why ? Probably too tired to figure it out)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway that's the most important thing I see at first glance. Goot template, nice work ! Hope you'll fine tuned it, as I'm planning to play FB pathfinder too this league and I'm always kin to get some new ideas ! Not sure its enough to mitigate the self-poisoning... the strength of those poisons would be crazy dangerous (you do reach 10m dps after all, and if you let those poisons ACCUMULATE on you !?), even with 84% chaos res, doppleganger, and good recov from flask. Hell I don't think you can sustain trough that kind of chaos dot even with 90% chaosres and three times the sustain from the new PF-flask thing.       
With the amulet though, yeah I can see it working for sure.        
        
I've played a few golden rule chars in the past, and I've never managed to make self-bleed or self-poison work on myself when I wasnt doing mainly elem dmg and had an extra 1-10 phys/chaos to proc the poison/bleed. This is litterally reflect for dots, and even 1% reflect is enough to kill many normal hitting builds trough strong defenses, and this is... 100% reflecting your dot, it's outrageously damaging Maybe I just have a deep-seated hatred for Sirus' die beams, but I'd still include a savage hit Forbidden Taste on any divine flesh PF build.  It might be pretty overkill on recovery, but it's at least worth keeping in mind in case you're getting chunked down by multiple big hits. I tried to do self poison chill before, the duration is too short imo and lethe shade is still bugged with reflected ailments as far as I know so you can't double it. You will have to get poison duration or keep using forbidden rite every 2 second. Maybe with enough cast speed that's not so bad I've never done self-poison before. Can someone tell me why its so great?   What does it do besides what the new mastery and new amulet provides? Isnâ€™t self poison with that amulet basically millions of hp per second? I think you underestimate how unplayable Forbidden rite is without the replica flask giving you mega EB, it's one of the most over costed skills mana wise in the game. Even with a enduring mana flask you can't really hold down the button for long, and that's with -mana cost rings. Also the surviablity is pretty trash without all the uniques which aren't that easy to come by day one if your not a mega blaster which would really impress me if you got both all the watchstones day one with this build without those uniques. [deleted] This looks wild, please keep updating with your results! looks extremely good but could have some small niggling issues you need to sort out once playing but as for a starting template this looks very strong. I was exactly thinking that this has potential to break the game yesterday after watching Asmodeus video. I even looked at 
WolfsGoRawr from last league where you can scale this build. I'm glad someone is looking to combine the two.
100% this might be busted. How do you get Dev-update to work? 

I have POB fork, v 2.25.1, and i have 'opt in to weekly beta test builds' ticked.

click check for update, i'm running latest version.

But i can't load the POB, says unrecognised version Do you have a gameplay showcasing how is the map clear of this build? At work and can't check pob but I love forbidden rite - is it ssf viable? Here is the version I cooked up. No self chill but same damage and better defenses.

https://pobb.in/dSgV8lisp7jN Can't you only apply one poison on yourself as well with the wording on the mastery? and it falls off after a period of time? Creating another gap.
