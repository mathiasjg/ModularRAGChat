Porcupine Tree, "Deadwing," warm soft passing takes precious things held dearer, rifle grey disappears, creep into darkness, make small hours clear. Anthrax: "Devil Knows Best," man brutal and mean deals business, obscene crosses recognized. Son, pull out the right eye. Unexploded ordinance. Megadeth, "Variate," "Tout Le Monde" remembers, realizes life is a serious game, takes things hard, rules ideas that cost life. Pass by with an eye to search for lyrics.
