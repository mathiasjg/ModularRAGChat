Thanks guys!!!

After that post blew up, my DMs got flooded with questions specifically about making money with AI.

given the interest, i scraped another 25K+ comments across social media to see which AI tools are actually making people money or saving time.

This time grok and gpt 5 deep research were used to analyze the data. Scraped from YouTube, Facebook Groups, Instagram, TikTok, X and Reddit.

Here’s the list:

1. Beautiful AI - make professional slideshows in just a few clicks. People report saving tons of time and there are even those who sell a service of redesigning ugly slideshows and are using this to do the work.

2. Suno AI - make insane quality music in just seconds. People are making jingles for companies. Others are making songs, releasing them through DistroKid, then earning royalties from Spotify and streamers.

3. Vubo AI - make viral worthy vertical videos in under a minute. People run faceless channels and earn through Adsense and sponsorships. Others use the video templates to make viral videos to promote their digital products or affiliate offers.

4. Browse AI - scrape and monitor websites without coding. Marketers are using it to build lead lists, researchers are selling data reports, and ecom owners are tracking competitor pricing automatically.

5. Chatbase - make a custom AI chatbot trained on your own data. Freelancers are selling “done-for-you” chatbots to businesses that want 24/7 customer support, while solopreneurs use it to have world class customer support and boost sales.

6. Instantly AI - send high-converting cold email campaigns that land in the inbox with ease. Some people sell done-for-you outreach as a service or use cold email to sell affiliate offers or generate leads which they sell to businesses.

7. OpusClip - cut long videos into shorts and easily add subtitles. People use this to turn podcasts or long form video into tons of TikToks, shorts and reels. Video editors also sell clipping as a service to influencers and businesses.

8. Indexly AI - submits your new or updated pages to Google and Bing so they get indexed in hours instead of weeks. Bloggers and ecom stores use it to grab traffic fast, while SEO freelancers resell “rapid indexing” as a service.

9. Fireflies AI - automatically record, transcribe, and summarize your meetings. People use it to create detailed call notes and many report it makes them way more efficient.

10. TryAtria - get ad inspiration from 25m winning ads, write better ad copy, and see what’s working right now. People use this to research competitors and create ad campaigns that convert better.

11. Higgsfield AI - turn photos into videos with cool video effects, generate ultra realistic people, make avatars that speak, and lots more. Basically a creative suite for marketers, creators and beyond.

12. StealthGPT AI - write human copy that is undetectable as AI and sounds like you. Many people report using this on school assignments, at work, and even in copywriting for their business. Many mentions in recent months.

im sure some are missing so feel free to share your own ways to save time or make money using AI.

Great roundup, tons of practical examples here. One thing I’ve seen work really well that isn’t often talked about is using AI for RFP and proposal automation in B2B sales. Most sales teams still waste hours on manual RFP reviews and writing, and it’s a grind to keep proposals consistent under tight deadlines. If you can streamline that with AI, you not only save a ton of time but can also actually increase your chances of winning deals. I’ve built a product in this space and happy to share more details if anyone’s curious. Just wanted to add this angle since it’s a real pain point for a lot of businesses. The audio quality of Suno AI is like 64 kbps mp3. Really bad. It was probably trained on many crappy streaming sources. 

I’d be embarrassed to submit a commercial track that sounded that bad.

Please do not think you can make jingles for companies and have them take you seriously, unless you’re looking at mom and pop shops that will pay you like $75 for your time. It would be good to see actual analytics.  One major problem of AI currently is it&#x27;s at such an infancy in the process and companies have yet to truly vet out the cost structure of AI.  Get several quarters in, a year, or more, and look at the analytics of the process, what kind of processes and personnel are required, the costing of the AI tools, the time spent using AI and post processing the outputs to get to marketable content.  Vet the numbers.

So far, I have not seen a single company, not a single person, ever, actually provide real world analytics of AI usage, the process and personnel, the steps required to operate at true commercial level tasks, and their resulting costs versus other or more specifically previous methods prior to AI.

The biggest problem is AI is not a vetted technology.  It does not have a proven track record.  People haven&#x27;t developed comprehensive processes with AI.  And no one, NONE have come to final costing of AI versus not AI.

I&#x27;m not personally in a process area that favors AI all that much.  I do engineering.  Within the whole scope of business around engineering and the array of tasks and processes, it has exceptionally minimal value.  But AI isn&#x27;t really tailored for this space.  It can only do a few low level mundane tasks.  And within those, it only has a few cases of real distinct value.  But over the course of a year of investment and availability to several AI tools, there are maybe 15 minutes of real value adding work that AI could significantly out perform traditional activities and tools.  But this 15 minutes translates to about a week of traditional work for someone.

Then it&#x27;s a question of cost.

For me, the value is in the realm of $1000 to $2000 a year, depending on who&#x27;s doing the work and their salary.

For the AI tools we use, mainly Copilot and Chat GPT, we can afford a yearly subscription to both and save money.  It sounds silly that way, but if I can compress a week of work to 15 minutes for some dumb task, it actually saves a lot of money.  The downside is the only value for AI for me is literally 15 minutes of work once or twice a year.  I have no need for a yearly subscription.  I need 15 minutes of paid time and small number of prompts, and that&#x27;s it.   So, it might be a $20 one month subscription or something, and then done.  11 months of the year, the AI tools have no value.  Well, this doesn&#x27;t fit very well into the whole mechanical infrastructure of AI that&#x27;s only efficient when continuously loaded with work and paying for the significant infrastructure.

This might be a long term shortcoming of AI.  When companies finally settle into a series of processes, many may fall into very infrequent use of AI.  Maybe 1 day a quarter is needed for a single bulk process task.  This is also assuming you don&#x27;t just develop a spreadsheet, program, macro, or ERP report to just automate the process anyways.  And that&#x27;s kind of the problem for me.  AI is only useful because of the laziness to not create that device yet.  For our ERP, we can have that built for us for about $2k, and then it&#x27;s done.  The ERP report does all the same work AI did without me having to have the work done.  But once I pay the $2k to have the report created, I have that forever for no additional cost.  And this is the greater risk of AI really.

The biggest risk to AI is companies having to seriously look at their processes and procedures to find ways to use AI.  And at the same time they also understand the specifics needed to do it through traditional methods.  The only difference is some up front cost and time to develop the tool versus using AI instead at a lower but repeat cost. Ah, this old chestnut again. Your AI did a good job writing some sludge about whatever this is about. RemindMe! 1 day Op, which system did you use to scrape data from all these social networks? will definitely be using some of these, do they use subscriptions? I&#x27;m wondering if there is an ai tool that would be more efficient at working out legal work of starting a business Cool breakdown surprised not to see HeyGen or Cluely on there since they’ve been blowing up with creators and sales teams curious if they didn’t show up in volume or just got filtered out also wondering how you scraped 25k comments without tripping TOS limits did you use public APIs or a custom crawler This is a good list to solve some of the repeat activities Commenting on this to save! Nice list! I’ve been using a few for ecom nd freelancing tools like Browse AI nd Instantly AI save tons of time, nd Vubo/OpusClip r perfect for creating fast content that actually makes money \^\^ I’m curious which of these were most useful! Did any of them rise above? What about Marblism? Has any one used it and have an opinion? Insane value, thank you. I wonder how fireflies compares to granola. I freaking love granola. Wow, 25K comments? Respect the hustle FANTASTIC post!!  Thank you for sharing some new resources to investigate! Have used OpusClip before, and looking forward to playing with the web scraper you mentioned!  You’ve done a great service to mankind today, fellow Reddit traveler! 💜😉 In light of some of the comments, I wanted to provide some insights into what some ai leveraged tools can do, and what it takes to build them. 

Great research. I enjoy seeing others interested in the development of AI. After 4 months of intense work, I launched a model that generates various marketing questionnaires, strategy, tactics, business, and audience reports.

My TAM are freelancers, marketers, and business owners. Aside of filling out customized questionnaires generated in minutes, all other reports take 2-3 minutes to create with up to 4,000+ words output.

I calculated, on a conservative basis, that a mid size agency could save a net $174,000/year by using my web app. Time saved would be around 1,400-1,600hrs/year, while the cost of running the reports on my web app would amount to $14,400/year.

I realize that there are many great tools out there leveraging AI, but often times, it is difficult to assess the net gain due to the lack of understanding of the underlying needs from a business. My web app cut down the research time to create solid output. To give you an idea of what goes into such results, some of my prompts are 10-20 pages long, with some having been iterated upon up to 32 times until I was satisfied with the results.

Now, there is always room for improvements, hence the relentless updates, feedback loop, and launch of new reports. This doesn’t include building the web app from scratch using vibe coding.

Anyhow, enjoyed reviewing some of the tools you mentioned. Thank you wow Awesome list, well done!! Nice list. I&#x27;ve messed around with Instantly and a few others. For B2B lead gen, my process has changed a lot recently though. Instead of just scraping (like with Browse AI) or cold emailing, I&#x27;ve had way mor success extracting people who engage with relevant posts on LinkedIn. Those leads are just so much warmer. Used to have a clunky workflow for it, but a tool I use now (Horlio) has this &#x27;Social Signals&#x27; feature that pretty much automates it. Finds the post, finds the people, warms them up. It replaced like 3 other tools for me. Thanks! Thank you I asked ChatGPT in 5 seconds I seriously doubt anyone is making any money with AI, if anything there is a blowback of all the AI generated content that is flooding Youtube.   If they would just post a counter for the downvotes, I think you will find that people loathe this type of content.   In terms of business, no body is paying anyone to create AI content.   THey just arn&#x27;t THey will laugh at your face, but more than not they will ghost you. How did you scraped all those comments? How do you so something like this? Thank you so much ! It’s a good job you did for us! I can&#x27;t wait for you to show us more and I wish you good luck. Great list! Thanks for putting it together. Thank you so much for this! How do you scrape comments like that tho? **Great list 👌 I’ve been using OpusClip and Browse AI, they actually save a ton of time.** Cyber security protocol for using random AI tools please nice list.

The last time I chatted with them, they said the legalities of releasing songs generated by them wasn&#x27;t fully sorted and they only generated mp3 quality. Following! Thanks Àaa and aAà Thanks for the list neat But I can’t find VUBOAI, is correct? share the actual analytics on keywords, sentiment, distribution, etc. Thanks 🙏 Thanks lol 2 days ago, I also got the same sources, thanks for sharing the list. Everyday is new day for everyone in this universe. Good luck to all! Interesting read, although I am generally opposed to AI!
Also, trying to get karma points so I can make my first original post, please feel free to help me out with that! New to Reddit, so hope it&#x27;s ok to ask outright...</pre></body></html>
