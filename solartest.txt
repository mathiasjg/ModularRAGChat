# The Solar System: An Overview

## Formation and Structure
The Solar System formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust. At its center is the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star that accounts for about 99.86% of the system's total mass. The Solar System consists of eight planets, divided into two main categories: terrestrial (inner) planets and gas giants (outer) planets.

The terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are rocky worlds with solid surfaces. The gas giants are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surfaces.

Beyond the planets, there are dwarf planets like Pluto, Eris, and Ceres. The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud contain icy bodies and comets.

## Key Planets and Moons
- **Mercury**: The smallest planet, closest to the Sun. It has no atmosphere and extreme temperature swings from -173°C to 427°C.
- **Venus**: Similar in size to Earth but with a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere causing a runaway greenhouse effect. Surface temperature averages 464°C.
- **Earth**: The only known planet with liquid water on its surface and life. It has one moon, Luna, which influences tides.
- **Mars**: Known as the Red Planet due to iron oxide. It has the largest volcano, Olympus Mons (22 km high), and evidence of past liquid water.
- **Jupiter**: The largest planet, with a mass 318 times that of Earth. It has over 90 moons, including Ganymede (largest moon in the Solar System) and Europa (with a subsurface ocean).
- **Saturn**: Famous for its ring system made of ice particles. It has 146 moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane.
- **Uranus**: Rotates on its side, with a tilt of 98 degrees. It has faint rings and 27 known moons.
- **Neptune**: The farthest planet, with strong winds up to 2,100 km/h. It has 14 moons, including Triton, which orbits retrograde.

## Exploration Milestones
- 1969: Apollo 11 lands on the Moon, first human footsteps by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.
- 1976: Viking 1 becomes the first spacecraft to land on Mars.
- 1997: Cassini-Huygens mission launches to study Saturn; Huygens probe lands on Titan in 2005.
- 2015: New Horizons flies by Pluto, revealing its heart-shaped feature.
- 2021: Perseverance rover lands on Mars, collecting samples for potential return to Earth.

## Interesting Facts
- The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter contains millions of rocky bodies, including Ceres, the largest asteroid and a dwarf planet.
- Comets like Halley's Comet originate from the Oort Cloud and have highly elliptical orbits.
- The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, about 26,000 light-years from the center.
- Potential for life: Europa and Enceladus (Saturn's moon) have subsurface oceans that could harbor microbial life.
