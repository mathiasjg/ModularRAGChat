[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**‚öî**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCave/) Is there any way I can buy Klarna shares now and pay in fixed installments? At the current IPO price it&#x27;ll be trading at 4x revenue. Affirm trades at 7x so there&#x27;s some room to run. Let&#x27;s see how greedy they get with upping the price closer towards IPO day. Hey, y&#x27;all know how everyone was taking up a ton of sub-prime debt in 2008 and that collapsed? What if that was our entire business model, but like, instead of the debt being for housing, its debt for people to pay for a pizza? Watch I&#x27;m only going to get assigned 1 share just like every other IPO I try to buy lol Klarna was an option to pay for my street parking that cost $3. Not really relevant to the stock but I think about that at least once a week. I put in for 100. We shall see. Massively bullish on the burrito lending market.

This thing&#x27;s going to the moon. I will borrow from Klarna to buy it https://preview.redd.it/6ofcthp0trmf1.jpeg?width=1121&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=670350cac5f118410312c7fc4d4b152692230aaa Easy flips are the best this will bump to $80 at open I bought and sold FIG on the day of listing. Robinhood said I am banned, but I did the same for BLSH no problemsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è SO I will do the same for KLAR as well. I‚Äôm liquidating my whole life into this company, free money. AI powering my ass This looks interesting, but FIGR is a better idea IMO. Was a Loan Officer a little while back. Worked with these guys a bit. They&#x27;ve got a great system for second mortgages. I love bubbles

I financed a $30 pair of TJ Max jorts with them (so of course I&#x27;m buying) I‚Äôm requesting 1,000 shares of KLAR, a 1,000 in GEMI, and 100 in FIGR. Idk, I feel like this is the regarded gamble I need. But for sure I‚Äôll be pulling out, and might be banned from IPOs for a while. https://preview.redd.it/jpzi68uw0tmf1.jpeg?width=1320&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c74924104b3c935a97a52d53d7e70b7fb739c8ea

Let‚Äôs run it https://preview.redd.it/ahnti8n91tmf1.jpeg?width=1179&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=af773fe921a5e39f0d79563a5ca16704fa0a0228

They have a cat in the prospectus, and for that reason, I‚Äôm full porting for my request. https://preview.redd.it/h84osah9qrmf1.jpeg?width=700&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4ff2bdd8f67471bf7d4254d23da2b6286be9e062 Gonna boom the first hour Well here we go again. How many yall requesting boys? Figure Technology just popped up for IPO as well I‚Äôm in for 10 shares let‚Äôs go Pisses me off to lock up capital for a couple weeks to be given 1 share üòÇ I‚Äôm using Klarna to buy klarna ipo shares https://preview.redd.it/3ewok0mw1tmf1.jpeg?width=300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c63dd5c0ca3d3d3e0d0a9464e127651b41636472 &quot;AI powered&quot;, fuck off. How do you request shares on Schwab? Oooo Big boom This is going to be crazy Sir, this is a Wendy&#x27;s.

We do accept Klarna for your Wednesday meal. Too late. Already went balls deep with BigTitty420Fart Coin: a currency with practical utility today and strong potential to the the global currency by 2035. Requested 1000, probably will get 5 haha I‚Äôm rug pulling just so you know Buying this garbage as the market turns bearish is very on brand for this sub. Godspeed. Where to get this for the europoors? ooooh

I hope I get a few shares to flip on day 1 AH like Figma!

I sold at $107 AFRM 2.0 How does this company generate profit? Lets goo, and this better than Bullish, and the next best competitor is valued at 9x, where this valued at 4x Three IPOs during a geyber week I do expect a sharp pop at open People getting angry at not getting enough pre allocated shares without realizing they can buy right at IPO day and still make some substantial profits as with Figma. Lmfao Based on the recent IPO pattern this should go down right when it starts trading.</pre></body></html>
