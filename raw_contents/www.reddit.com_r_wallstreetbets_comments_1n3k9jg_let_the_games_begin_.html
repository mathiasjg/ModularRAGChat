[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) Here comes the “radical activist woke judges shouldn’t be allowed to stop us from breaking the law and doing whatever we want” outrage

followed by the Supreme court letting them do whatever they want and reinstating all the tariffs

For some reason I feel like this is priced in due to the lack of reaction on Liberation day 2.0 The Supremes are gonna overturn this because they live in 🌮’s colon. It’s already priced in LMAO Have you heard of the Supreme Court? Trump can do pretty much whatever he wants. right now futures market DGAF about this news so probably not lol. Read the article you regards. Tariffs still on until Oct for when Supreme Court rules on it.

Anyways.

Nov 1st calls on Spy it is! I vaguely remember hearing a judge ruling the tariffs illegal earlier on, nothing changed. Congress has their butt cheeks spread so wide they probably can’t tell anymore when they’re being fucked. BERS DEAD!! THEY’RE TUMBLING DOWN THE FIELD! BAH GAWD STOP THE MATCH! Ore nore. My puts I hope that judge likes Uganda Priapisms for us all!

....and lady priapisms They couldn’t do it on Monday before I had to sell my spy calls for 0.01? https://preview.redd.it/623yjri0a1mf1.png?width=1079&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7fc33ccbf9adcf9cfa6262ec7098fc5bbcbe0859 Trump’s theory: courts control the market
Reality: market control the courts So what happens if T loses his main tool of conducting international and domestic policy.  I fear it will be like a cornered animal that gets desperate and wants to destroy something Bessent using tears for lube on Theils shaft this weekend No tariffs are still in effect until future rulings Isn’t this bearish? no mr bond market i expect you to moon im just buying more open To mars I think for the coming weeks You know he’s going to somehow overturn it. Right? This September bout to be 🔥, most volatile start to fall in a while &quot;But the judges delayed the implementation of their order until October to grant the administration time to seek review by the Supreme Court, which would allow the duties to remain in place for now.&quot;


From WSJ 


So no, tariffs are still uncertain  Are we pretending this exact story didn’t already happen months ago? Nothing is gonna happen NEWS FLASH ASSHOLE  
priced in! I remember when the Revolutionary War popped off because the lower house of Parliament in England established a tax with the goal to raise revenue. Something about taxation without representation and all… and now we are here. The tariffs are still in effect because the appeals court decided to withhold its mandate until October. Calls it is, on margin this is bearish as fuck, regards With the holiday, nobody will remember this come Tuesday Before people were scammed. Now countries are scammed. F to those who bribed him for nothing Tuesday to the moon!  🚀  Who else bought calls before close? If you are still buying puts I don’t know what to tell you Fake news</pre></body></html>
