Been experiencing these for a while, these weird visual effects on my top left of my vision occur mostly at the night 9pm or later. Maybe if I look at a screen. It’s like a minor blind spot.

It’s like a colorful but mostly black and white static with bright flickering lights or moving lights at the left top or middle of my vision that’s constantly moving or shifting.I say, floaters and flashers. Go to eye doctor to confirm; they can see them with modern equipment. PVD. If there’s a lot of them, run to ER. Floaters? It sounds like a migraine aura. Epilepsy can also cause similar auras. Regardless, if it is new, please go see a doctor. Migraine? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma
