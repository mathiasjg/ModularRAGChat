Porcupine Tree, &quot;Deadwing,&quot; warm soft passing takes precious things held dearer, rifle grey disappears, creep into darkness, make small hours clear. Anthrax: &quot;Devil Knows Best,&quot; man brutal and mean deals business, obscene crosses recognized. Son, pull out the right eye. Unexploded ordinance. Megadeth, &quot;Variate,&quot; &quot;Tout Le Monde&quot; remembers, realizes life is a serious game, takes things hard, rules ideas that cost life. Pass by with an eye to search for lyrics.</pre>
