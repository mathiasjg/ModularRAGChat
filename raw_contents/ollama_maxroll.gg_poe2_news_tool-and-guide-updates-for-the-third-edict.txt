The Third Edict update and Rise of the Abyssals League bring significant changes to Path of Exile 2, including an expanded passive tree and a complete overhaul of support gems. We've updated our tools for the new league and are working on updating the build guides.

### Guide Updates
The changes to the passive tree, the new Support Gem system, and Lineage supports mean there will likely be numerous guide updates during the first week of the league. If you're following a guide, pin the post to be notified of updates! We expect this process to take a few days due to the scope of the changes.

### Tool Updates
The following tools are now updated for The Third Edict 0.3 and the Rise of the Abyssals League:

- Passive Tree Instilling Calculator

Note: Lineage Support gems will be added to PoE2Planner shortly!
