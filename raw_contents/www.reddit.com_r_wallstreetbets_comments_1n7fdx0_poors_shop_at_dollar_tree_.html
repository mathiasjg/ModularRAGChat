[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**‚öî**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCave/) I mean it&#x27;s the only place I can go as a poor and have a tiny bit of joy spending money. You spend 20 on a jug of tide at target Karen, I spend 20 on toilet paper cleaning supplies snacks, small container of tide, pair of sandals, batteries and some Halloween decorations. Your realized profits are nothing to you but life changing to some of us. A bank account with 4 digits is something I don&#x27;t ever see. I&#x27;m 40 bruh and never been on anything close to what some would consider a vacation. Dollar trees a savior.¬† Overpriced landfill. If Costco is heaven, dollar tree is hell. Daiso&amp;gt; Dollar tree Dollar Tree is fumbling with the pricing transition and putting red stickers on everything. Planograms in disarray and you can&#x27;t tell the price of the items easily, if at all. Looks like a junked up, unmarked yard sale now. I will always support Dollar Tree. I never forgot my roots. Tasteless. Have some decorum. I buy my cleaning supplies there ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The trick is you buy items there that aren‚Äôt priced above their usual retail price Me. I like buying little decorations The only thing I buy from Dollar Tree is birthday/holiday cards. Only place where I can get a generic $1 card. Grocery stores charge like $6 nowadays. Dope man sits in his car out in the parking lot.... I don&#x27;t get why the poors are mad at you in these comments lol. This is WSB, not the front page. Good shit Shit post! 300,000+ laid off tech workers I guess. That‚Äôs the only place I can go in without getting furious about price increases.¬† I shop at dollar tree Who the fuck says &quot;lolz&quot; Places where you don&#x27;t find Walmart, you find Dollar tree or a  Family Dollar. Out in the middle of nowhere is where Dollar tree thrives.
Say, are Dollar tree and family Dollar related? Time to find a clue.  It&#x27;s not always about price, its about availability.  Its school time, Walmart and Target are wiped out. Joannes is gone. Michael&#x27;s is too expensive (and low on stock too).   I need posterboards and glitter glue, and cute animal staplers, and pipe cleaners and fuzzy balls and glass stones and faux stained glass window ornaments to paint and...yeah.  The dollar store provides!  They order enough to serve the community. 

The dollar store has come through with 12 different dinosaur models, barnyard animals, jungle animals.  It has stuffed items with eyes sewn on - toddler safe.  It has essentials for puppies too.  Cotton (washable) leashes, stuffed animals safe for chewing, freezable chew toys.  

We go to the dollar store, because it has what we need. Did they have earnings or something? nice play! i shoulda known puts after the one time i went to dollar tree this summer they lost power I go to DG because it‚Äôs right before my friends house and I pick up beer there instead of the gas station next door that charges an arm and a leg I enjoyed spending $20 on a bunch of low quality small items lol. But also had 2 100 puts because i feel they are overpriced compared to other retailers Nah, the dollar tree has some really good energy drinks. 3d, rip it, and gfuel are sold at dollar trees. And yes a lot of the gfuel is gross but they still have a couple good ones left. Your account is 3 years old and you‚Äôve made 8 total posts.  Congrats on your first green day lolz. Bullish catalist Nice job. I was looking at earning last week and wanted to play this PUT, but the volume looked too low. Nice job for taking a risk. Hopefully shoe carnival and aber&amp;amp;fitch fall down this week All this time I thought Gain was a laundry detergent.... this probably wont get answered but how long was he in for? and also what the fuck how can i re create this why did he buy at that time Lol Can confirm this didnt age well Not enough balls to hold. My town is a very nice like near zero crime place, and we still avoid the local dollar tree because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd get mugged</pre></body></html>
