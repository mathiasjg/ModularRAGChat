[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) Holy fuck Wait‚Ä¶ so buy and hold is actually the best strategy? Was 7.49 a year ago with a 12.30 breakeven lol held for a whole year that‚Äôs nutty Respect for you for holding one whole year

I saw when you bought on the chart and you were lucky sofi launched up like a rocket https://preview.redd.it/nvzgcd6vsrlf1.png?width=227&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=be5f5a437ec91e917c72672244526a2e3bfd49cf Your hands must be tired,boss. [removed] [deleted] 
Phenomenal. How much sleep did you lose over this and was it worth it? I had few thousand SOFI shares before I switched brokers too and decided not to rebuy lol. You held through the April downturn too, was there any point where the options were underwater?

I bought 70k in leaps on RDDT yesterday but was leveraged and nervous about nvda, sold out. Would&#x27;ve been up 8-10 k today. Congrats Nice, also big balls here Thanks for sharing this, I recently started buying LEAPs and I don‚Äôt have one with amount of dollar value but the craziest for me has been $OPEN which gained 800% but unfortunately I only bought 1 contract ü§£ With the call option being so deep ITM and having a high delta, is it easy to sell your contracts? congrats! what&#x27;s a better play than sofi right now?!? This is the way to do it! Been slowly building up the courage myself but I&#x27;m stuck playing with 6 month right now Damn I took a step back Now switch to Nio for another 5-600% in one year üòÇ Congratulations man Congrats and fuck you Good shit, OP.  I just went in big on BULL with a similar strategy.  LEAPS are fun üíéfist!!! Congrats, I wish I can find and hold enough such a profitable play xD whats the next one Man i bought and sold SOFI leaps 4 times already this past year.  Currently holding some March 2026 25. This is exactly what I needed to see to know the top is in How do you guys find a good stock to buy ? Newbie here ! Yup I held SOFI for a little over a year had a 10 dollar strike price unfortunately I did not buy many contracts‚Ä¶ What are we playing next king? Amazon leaps??? But how do you exit into liquidity at that point? Who will take them? Without exercising them This is the way Hell yeah sexy lady Leaps are the way. I find something I‚Äôd like to hold shares on and get leaps. Has worked out wayyyyy better than short term options. Short term is great for gambling but that‚Äôs legit it Leaps is the better play for sure. I dont have the psyche for 0dte lol Nice! Now you&#x27;re taxed on longterm capital gain. Congrats. impressive to hold through q1 of this year after that run and then drop Wow. That was a scary march/april huh $23k into $168k in one year not a bad trade I fucking hate being Europoor Damn that premium was juicy. What a deal Congrats. I don‚Äôt have the patience for leaps or any contract longer than 1 week lol I&#x27;m proud of you son üëè THIS ...IS...IT... !!! damn, nicely done Damn!!!! Epic! Congrats man held for a year, nice now it&#x27;s time for a long dated put! Holding leaps for a year isn‚Äôt treated as owning the stock for a year for capital gains unfortunately right? Anyways, congrats and f u lol üòÜ¬†</pre></body></html>
