Set the World Afire lyrics by Megadeth:
Want to set the world on fire,
Red flash and cloud, choke the morning sky.
Say come, know no lie from life's die.
Human succumb; time kisses ass goodbye.

End begin, distorted figure walks the street.
1999, weeds grow 'neath my feet, vines entwine.
Bodies melt like candles in the land of time.
Change your fate, leave it late. Arsenal against Megadeth, ride the tide.

come living envy dead racing power come winning stone cast falsehood worldly peace treaty soon cease leave prove human exist maybe soon child bear open fisted live planet smoke bad lethal energy final scene global darken Dig deep pile rubble ruin tower overhead far wide unknown tool World War III Einstein say use rock survivor set world afire survivor set world afire

believe in the bone bear grave, feel the big ole pile of bones Aaah Aaah Aaaaaaaaah as dust rises right to the end. Motorhead's love forever, love forever, until the end tethered back by the wall. Hand asks for a promise, live till I die, change and stay true. Anthrax law year academy like cadet see man hard veins bleed ice speak twice. Judge Dredd breaks suicidal tendencies, institutionalized to try, work the way we want real change. Frustrated like trying hard like time runs out, work the way it should.
