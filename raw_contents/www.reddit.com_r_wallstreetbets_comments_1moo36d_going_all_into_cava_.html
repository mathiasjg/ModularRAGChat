[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) I said the same thing about UNH. Me with LULU now I‚Äôm a bag holder. For an ‚Äúall in,‚Äù this is downright conservative. Straight equity, no leverage, no YOLO options‚Ä¶ feels pretty tame for WSB standards. Good luck though Something something falling knife something something All in at 87% diversity You see a hummus covered falling knife and you just step under it like that Are you guys serious?  A Mediterranean restaurant chain?  Has any one of you ever had ONE good idea in your lives Yup, did the same thing with LLY, and they had EXCELLENT earnings. Down $6k. Good luck, that spicy Chicken Avocado Pita is the bomb lol. And it‚Äôs gone How do i get reminders?  I think so many people had options on this thing and it didn&#x27;t blow anything out of the water some slight selling caused an avalanche in covers, id say you&#x27;re right but wait till morning Damn man. Say goodbye to your money. So many better choices right now Godspeed. Definitely buying shares in the 60s.  It‚Äôs on sale and the growth prospects of the company long term are still intact. They just had a bad quarter God damn, cant wait to see the loss pornü•π Economy lowkey cooked holy regard Pain Confirmed. Buy $65 10/17 puts. Perfectly balanced portfolio. I&#x27;m betting OP gonna be holding that shit for a minute. Someone recommended I short CAVA yesterday and forgot to push it thru ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You will actually make money on this one ü§ë https://preview.redd.it/hea7al83kpif1.jpeg?width=967&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1bee6f219d981e19512e5540cfce790a4a6a9d6c Cava is not worth it. Chipotle provides way better value [deleted] I just bought 1000 shares at 65.5 Remind me in 5 days RemindMe! 1 week All three companies sales are down and they are struggling, better put your money in a tahini jar at Costco.. I was looking for you I have been watching Cava for a couple of years now, and I  got couple of options play out of it. will go go back up to ninety range by earning. But I would went leap on this one instead of shares. https://preview.redd.it/qmrjgzckzpif1.jpeg?width=1919&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c17bfc515196b37144c36cddb8489328a0c7aa79 Going all in with you brother Why?¬† It was hyped last year.¬† Sales are down. Only way to get sales up is to sell food that appeals to more people.¬† Hoo boy ü´£ Nice how much profit did u make ? Foods garbage and over priced. Technically that‚Äôs not a swing.  I saw this post thinking you went short not long.  But good luck with your position. Get out fast, I think Cava is ultimately going to struggle to keep up with it&#x27;s current sales. It&#x27;s absurd how expensive a basic meal is there. It&#x27;s novelty is going to wear off relatively quickly and then price sensitivity is going to push people elsewhere. It&#x27;s likely why they haven&#x27;t seen much increased growth at the stores. If you live in any decent size city you can get the same type of food for much less. Going to drop more tomorrow. Is cava in the south/east? I‚Äôve never heard of this until I came here On positive my kid wears this place out, but they revised guidance on same-restaurant sales (comps): cut to 4‚Äì6% from 6‚Äì8%. RemindMe! 1 day Why? Sounds like a way to lose a lot given it cut its outlook. Woulda  been better off cmg This makes zero sense lmao Buy MP, it‚Äôs a monopoly it will continue to go up and has a ton of use cases in our economy CAVA&#x27;s main location: Washington, D.C.

Trump to Washington, D.C.: &quot;You&#x27;re fired!&quot;

WSB to CAVA: &quot;I&#x27;m all in!&quot;</pre></body></html>
