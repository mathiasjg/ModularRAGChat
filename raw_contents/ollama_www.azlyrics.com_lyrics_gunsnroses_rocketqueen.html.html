Rocket Queen lyrics by Guns N&#x27; Roses:  
Need thing &#x27;cause turn like, turn get tongue like razor sweet switchblade knife favor like.  
Rocket Queen, little young honey be naive.  
Rocket Queen, oh yeah honey, bit obscene see.  
Imaginable pass eye tangible, honey surprised sexual innuendo burn paradise.  
Turn well, turn tonight Rocket Queen.  
Little young honey be naive.  
Rocket Queen, oh yeah honey, bit obscene.

Little, young honey, be naive, Rocket Queen oh yeah.
Honey, bit obscene, standin&#x27; standin&#x27; lonely place, need shoulder, need friend.
Stand at the bitter end, need sorrow, need pain, hate walking in the rain.
Chastise think mean harm, leave, string far.
Baby yeah, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh baby yeah.
Leave, want to know care.

Crazy like Rocket Queen, Black Sabbath, Grave Revolution; mind-melting starts and marches across the world. Live in hate, hearts tired, push to tellâ€”Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Dude (Look Out for That Train).&quot; 

Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga, Cruise by the bar shore, picture grace under grime. Iron Maiden, &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight,&quot; kill and gain, shoot and maim; a need for reason.

Golden Goose, loose in season, blacken pride, burn inside like a shell. Bloody treason, guns aimed. Feelgood Rat Tail Jimmy, second-hand deals, Hollywood gets 65 Chevy primers to flame trade powder good. Jigsaw&#x27;s Jimmy game, hear do.

Got a. Megadeth &quot;Tout Le Monde&quot; remember to realize life is a serious game and take things seriously. It&#x27;s a rule we must follow, an idea that has cost us much in our lives but passes like a fleeting glance. Find the lyrics [here](https://www.lyrics.com/Megadeth+-+Tout_Le_Monde_Lyrics).</pre>
