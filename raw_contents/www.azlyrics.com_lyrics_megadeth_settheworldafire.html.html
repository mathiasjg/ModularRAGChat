    <pre>(I don&#x27;t want to set the world on fire...)



Red flash, clouds choking out the morning sky

They said it&#x27;d never come, we knew it was a lie

All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb

Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun



Distorted figures walk the street, it&#x27;s 1999

Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines

Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face

No time to change your fate, no time left, it&#x27;s too late

No time to change your fate, no time left, it&#x27;s too late



The arsenal of megadeath can&#x27;t be rid they said

And if it comes, the living will envy the dead

Racing for power, and all come in last

No winning, first stone cast

This falsehood, worldly peace

Its treaties soon will cease



No one will be left to prove that humans existed

Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted

We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke



Too bad they couldn&#x27;t see this lethal energy

Too bad they couldn&#x27;t see this lethal energy

And now the final scene, a global darkening



Dig deep, piles of rubble and ruins

Towering overhead both far and wide

There&#x27;s unknown tools for World War III

Einstein said &quot;We&#x27;ll use rocks on the other side.&quot;

No survivors!



Set the world afire!



No survivors, set the world afire!</pre>
