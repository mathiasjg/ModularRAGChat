I'm not some automation guru doing $100K months. Just a guy who figured out why 80% of my first automations sat unused while clients went back to doing things manually.

Here's what actually matters when selling AI to businesses:

**Integration beats innovation every single time**

Most people build automations that work perfectly in isolation. Cool demo, impressive results, complete waste of money.

The real question isn't "does this work?" It's "does this work WITH everything else they're already doing?"

I learned this the hard way with a restaurant client. Built them an amazing AI system for managing orders and inventory. Technically flawless. They used it for exactly 3 days.

Why? Their entire operation ran through group texts, handwritten notes, and phone calls. My "solution" meant they had to check another dashboard, learn new software, and change 15 years of habits.

**Map their actual workflow first (not what they say they do)**

Before I build anything now, I spend 2-3 days just watching how they actually work. Not the process they describe in meetings. What they ACTUALLY do hour by hour.

Key things I track:

* What devices are they on 90% of the time? (usually phones)
* How do they communicate internally? (texts/calls, rarely email)
* What's the one system they check religiously every day?
* What apps are already open on their phone/computer?

Perfect example: Calendly. Makes total sense on paper. Automated scheduling, no back-and-forth texts about meeting times.

But for old-school SMB owners who handle everything through texts and calls, it creates MORE friction:

* Opening laptops instead of staying on phone
* Checking Google Calendar regularly
* Managing email notifications consistently
* Learning new interfaces they don't want

Your "time-saving solution" just became a 3x complexity nightmare.

**Build around their existing habits, not against them**

Now I only build automations that plug into their current flow. If they live in text messages, the automation sends updates via text. If they check one dashboard daily, everything routes there.

My landscaping client example: They managed everything through a shared WhatsApp group with their crew. Instead of building a fancy project management system, I built an AI that:

* Reads job photos sent to the group chat
* Automatically estimates hours needed
* Sends organized daily schedules back to the same chat
* Tracks completion through simple emoji reactions

Same communication method they'd used for 8 years. Just smarter.

**The friction audit that saves deals**

I ask every client: "If this automation requires you to check one additional place every day, will you actually do it?"

90% say no immediately. That's when I know I need to rethink the approach.

The winners integrate seamlessly:

* AI responds in whatever app they're already using
* Output format matches what they're used to seeing
* No new logins, dashboards, or learning curves
* Works with their existing tools (even if those tools are basic)

**What actually drives adoption**

My best-performing client automation is embarrassingly simple. Just takes their daily phone orders and formats them into the same text layout they were already using for their crew.

Same information, same delivery method (group text), just organized automatically instead of manually typing it out each morning.

Saves them 45 minutes daily. Made them $12K in avoided scheduling mistakes last month. They didn't have to change a single habit.

**What I took away**

A simple automation they use every day beats a complex one they never touch.

Most businesses don't want an AI revolution. They want their current process to work better without having to learn anything new.

Stop building what impresses other developers. Build what fits into a 50-year-old business owner's existing routine.

Took me a lot of no's and unused automations to figure this out.Honestly for someone starting out this is incredible advice, in most niches the age span of people who are decision makers is usually 30-60 years and they dont really care about AI or agents, all they want is their work simplified and made more efficient and thats what some people dont realize, every client has different requirements and different ways of working, and as a SaaS we should tailor to that. This guy just described what UX is and why it’s so important to be product lead not engineering led. So basically the scripts I do for my own repetitive bullshit work flows but for others without extra steps. Got it. Thanks  How did you train the AI to estimate time/effort from photos for the landscape business? And how did you test the accuracy? Seems like a huge task, would love to learn more about that I'll bite.

How in the hell do you build an “amazing AI system for managing orders and inventory” without ever asking how they manage that in the first place? 

Also, do they pay monthly, flat rate, what's your business model, hosting, etc etc

I call bullshit tbh

Edit: You can't build anything for anyone without understanding their needs. Wtf How are you acquiring customers? Oh wow, did you sell it as a productized service, or custom made for each individual case? These are wise words… How long did it take to reach 10k? 15k in five months selling AI automations? That’s legit hustle right there. But the real flex is how you scale once demand crushes your capacity—doubt custom ChatGPT hacks stay sustainable forever. The gold is turning your automations into templates, plugins, or a SaaS that breeds itself while you nap.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AI_Agents) if you have any questions or concerns.* How are you managing your automations for your clients? Do they maintain it themselves once it's built? If you need another team member to help you while ur grow I’d definitely be interested! It's incredibly frustrating to see your hard work go unused because it doesn't fit seamlessly into a client's existing workflow. I've been there, and it's a tough lesson to learn. Many of us have faced the challenge of creating technically sound solutions that ultimately gather dust because they require too much change from the client. I'm curious, what was the turning point for you in realizing the importance of mapping out their actual workflow before diving into development? Saving this , really helpful  It is called system business analysis’. Usually it should come before any development. How did you manage to sell a landscaping business on an automation solution? Seems like the least likely place to be looking for AI integration. Couldn’t agree more—no matter how flashy, solutions that add friction never get used. I always shadow actual workflows first and build automations that live inside their existing chats or spreadsheets. That simple “will they open this every day?” sanity check has saved me more dev hours than any fancy feature ever could When you automate, are you using n8n or some other tool? Do you self host or are they cloud based? And how do you manage monthly costs of running automation for clients? While rhey may lay a lump sum, now they are dependent on your service to manage those automations. Are you now on-call or provide some support package? following! Great read. I have been designing and developing for years. From my experience many clients end-up with systems they struggle to use. Over complicated, blotted, way over budget and hard to maintain! This hits the nail. I had a similar experience. Giving another SAAS tool means another dashboard to look at, more of their productive time to learn the software and use it properly etc 

Most of our customers always came back asking for integrations- does this work with Zoho CRM, does this work with Odoo, can I push this into my CRM etc 

They want to use their existing tools and adding another tool to the belt would actually decrease their productivity. 

My learning was we stripped everything that made my SAAS app look complicated and we released a lite version of it and that does 1 thing really well and our customers loved it. We made it 1 time setup and integrated into their CRM so they don’t have to keep coming back, but the core AI workflow kept it going and it showed up on their CRMs.

So 1 less dashboard to look at, the better it is. great post. "meet your customer where they live" is a timeless lesson. my impression is that LLMs aren't ready to be part of business workflows, and especially not SMB, where margins are tight and patience is thin. Rather, LLM coding tools enable the creation of simple solutions at a FAR lower cost than was previously possible, opening up whole new markets, like the example you shared. Bravo! Indeed insightful! I can't code. Is it something you need to code or is it possible to do with n8n or make? I have an AI agent idea. Can I DM you my idea to get some feedback? Beeaniegeni Very helpful/useful post. Thoroughly enjoyed it How do you find your first few clients? Been looking over Google, using chat to find underdeveloped businesses? Most places I find seem to have something in place already. Any starting out advice for finding clients? And what platform are you using for the automations? Make or zapier or n8n or something else? Also, do you make them install this or do you manage this yourself and take a monthly flat fee? Like what are the rates which you charge. I have taught myself to handle make and zapier so let me know if I can provide other businesses solutions with them? I am still learning n8n so yeah Congrats, you discovered human-centred design. “Integration beats innovation” is absolutely right. Great post, wise approach Can you help me at my real estate brokerage? We need help automating things more simpler. Nice What is your go to market for these clients ? Email ? Thank you for ur insights so much value, i appreciate ur time ! have an amazing day! @OP Really helpful. Thank you! Easily the best post I've seen on AI automations to date. Love it man. I think you helped me a lot to deal with this client that I have for a couple of years now. We built a system for them but they barely use it, we end up using it all the time for them. 

Now I guess I could try a different approach. I'll take your word that this is legit. 

The companies that use your automations for three days and then stop using them. Do you keep working with them until you find a solution that works for them or do you just walk away from it? How to sell this? "Reads job photos sent to the group chat, Automatically estimates hours needed"  
  
I was a landscaper for around 15 years, and I've been working heavily in AI for the last four years And I'd love to hear a little bit more about how this could be possible, tbhI I can't think of any way any existing AI model (or agent or system) would be able to look at a photograph and understand how long it would take to complete a landscaping job,

I would love to learn more because I find this to be truly incredible. This is an incredibly valuable post. You’re showing what a customer centric approach actually looks like when implementing AI to help Main St businesses. Thank you! Spot on. My wife is a Notion consultant and the adoption pattern is exactly the same. Her clients don't want new. But they do want better. 

And never underestimate people's unwillingness to change. Especially if they're the ones being asked to use the new system.

Thanks for sharing. Curious — when you shifted to this “integration-first” mindset, did you change your sales pitch too? Like, do you now lead with “we fit into your current flow” instead of demoing new dashboards? Maybe one day Ill do this too... who wants to help me?? 50/50 I've seen this happen with so many projects. It's a hard lesson to learn, but it makes so much sense. How do you approach the "integration" part now? Do you have a discovery process that's more focused on existing workflows? That is soo true. Encountered the same with my agency. Tried to sell regular dashboard analytics and they never even opened. Trying to move them to use an AI agent instead and it’s a bit better but they still rather ask the employees This sounds awesome. The Liam Ottely’s AAA Accelerator helped me a lot. I have the course if anyone is interested! Amazing insight
