Either because it fell apart or it&#x27;s used as a door stop, or as a reference guide.

If you do manage to get one be prepared for the binding to fall apart. Fix it with flexible silicone glue, anything that gets hard and brittle will just break again under the weight. The new edition that is out has a lot of updates. Best to get the new one. Maybe eBay, someone has it and is trying to get rid of it.Â  Library?  Inter-library loan?</pre></body></html>
