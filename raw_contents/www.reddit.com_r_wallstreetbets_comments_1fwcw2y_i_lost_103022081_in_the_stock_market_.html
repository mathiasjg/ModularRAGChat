The shame, guilt, lies. Pretending to be cool and knowing what the fuck I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;ve been holding this in for years. I&#x27;ve cried and cried and cried. I&#x27;m fed up with my bitch behavior. It&#x27;s time to fucking take things into my own hands and change. I&#x27;m not stopping, I&#x27;m going to gain this all back the slow, and right way. Here&#x27;s my story.

In 2019 I learned about the stock market. Like a responsible retail investor, I created baskets and diversified my equity investments.

In 2020, I learned about options.

My first gamble was a meme stock I found on WSB that rhymes with Ped Pad Peyon. That was the start of my entire $1M loss and life downfall.

It felt so good to see those big spikes in gains.

But it also felt like the end of the world when it all went to $0.

For some reason, I always came back. I tasted the forbidden fruit, and was addicted.

Fast forward two years, I needed a source for more trading capital - I sold my house and car, maxed out credit cards, borrowed from the bank, and lenders. I lied to family/friends to get money, and worked odd jobs that were shameful.

My wife who I&#x27;d been with for 12 years left me, we didn&#x27;t sign a prenup so there was that whole process...then she took custody of the kids.

Sure, I lost $1,030,220.81. But the worst part of it all, is I lost loved ones, every friend in my life, and every single asset I owned. I cried like a fucking bitch for days on end, slept on benches, backyards, and under bridges.

I managed to save up some money, and am now living on my own, in a one-bedroom apartment.

I know it I can do this. I know I can make it all back. I&#x27;ve heard stories and seen people do it. I understand all the technical analysis, indicators, price action, gamma exposure, OI, risk-free interest, blah blah fucking blah. I know it all. What made me lose it all wasn&#x27;t my understanding of the markets, it was my ego, my greed, and lack of discipline. My psyche.

I&#x27;ve spent the last 2 yrs dedicating myself to mastering every technical aspect of the market. I&#x27;ve met 10 figure retail investors, hedgefund managers, and everyone in between. Really dedicated myself to learning the markets. Most importantly, I&#x27;ve made good progress mastering my emotions. I&#x27;ve even gone on months without masturbating. I needed to model a stimulus that was just as rewarding as gambling.

I&#x27;m here to show that I can gradually get out of this hell-hole.

I&#x27;ve managed to trade back up to $25k, and in the last week I made $14k (options + futures). I will get back to $1M. I&#x27;m just here to prove to the world and myself that this isn&#x27;t over.

Is it the most hedged / low risk decision? Fuck no. The degen surely lives on inside me. But I&#x27;ve tamed it. I guess if you&#x27;re looking for entertainment, or a person to root for, you can find me on X. Username is lost1million. I&#x27;ll try to give periodic updates here as well.

This is pretty much it for me. Here we go.

P.S. Please don&#x27;t report me to the suicide prevention. While I appreciate the sympathy, the messages I get are quite annoying. I will be fine. I am fine.

[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) Usually in most posts we see a small uptick (first ones free) before the crash. Yours is just all downward trajectory. Congrats youâ€™re King Regard. &quot;It felt so good to see those big spikes in gains.&quot;

are the big spikes of gains in the room with us now?

see you monday regard Yknow when the degenerate gamblers STOP masturbating that theyâ€™ve really fucked up &amp;gt;I&#x27;ve managed to trade back up to $25k, and in the last week I made $14k (options + futures). I will get back to $1M. I&#x27;m just here to prove to the world and myself that this isn&#x27;t over.

You belong here. How does a random homeless guy meet with 10 figure retail investors and hedge funds? https://preview.redd.it/pt6a7v2mpusd1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0244731210f999c1c3676185baab038765bd800b &amp;gt;Is it the most hedged / low risk decision? Fuck no. The degen surely lives on inside me. But I&#x27;ve tamed it.

No you haven&#x27;t you fucking smooth brained neanderthal. The only thing you&#x27;ve tamed is the voice inside your head telling you you have a goddamn gambling addiction. You lost *everything* but *now* is different? When was the last time you thought that huh? When you lost your first 10k? 100k? 500k? When your wife left you? When you sold your house? When you were borrowing money from friends and family like some drug addicted asshole? Did you notice the similarities there? just put the fries in the bag bro Only 100000 customers to.greet behind the dumpster, and you can make it back champ. If you&#x27;d invested 1,069,000 in S&amp;amp;P 500 ETF TRUST ETF (SPY) on August 6, 2018, today the investment would be worth 2,284,946.82
Total profit: 1,215,946.82 The irony of saying that he did all of this studying TA bullshit, but his portfolio is steeper than a double black diamond ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Bro, are you also into astrology? I feel like you could have left out the masturbation part. https://preview.redd.it/h3yjrkwsavsd1.png?width=516&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d7ce2d3d46ce0230b7dbaec85d3558c702f712f8

Mel, is this you? Iâ€™m sorry where are these spikey gains you were talking about? It looks like you had a million dollars and threw it off a cliff and then still had forty grand at the end. This is a bullshit sob story and only slightly awesome loss porn. Now this loss is your entire personality? Whatâ€™s with these usernames? Are you trying to capitalize off of being a regard and youâ€™re gonna post later a screenshot of your portal back up with like $4M and then try to give financial advise? This is weird bro How did you get over 1 million of liquidity to start with? My man, you were up 2k with 1 mil leverage... try something else would be my best advice Honestly bro I&#x27;m having a hard time believing your story, you&#x27;re telling me you were so addicted to betting on meme stocks like BBBY, a shitty store that sells candles and towels, that you fucked over everyone in your life, and ended up sleeping under bridges? It doesn&#x27;t add up. Your chart goes off a cliff, it does not look like you were up at literally any point. I understand that gambling addiction is a real thing, and people do some crazy stuff, but what the fuck were you actually doing here? Now you&#x27;re saying you &quot;met with hedge fund managers&quot;, what the fuck does that even mean my man? You&#x27;re leaving out a lot of the story or it&#x27;s fake for internet points. Its time you stop dabbling in options. What other indications do you need before you stop? Waiting for new username ilost2mil holy fuck this makes me feel so much better about myself losing 20k this week &amp;gt; But I&#x27;ve tamed it

No you haven&#x27;t

&amp;gt; I&#x27;ve managed to trade back up to $25k, and in the last week I made $14k (options + futures). I will get back to $1M. I&#x27;m just here to prove to the world and myself that this isn&#x27;t over.

Bro you proved to yourself that you suck at this already.

Go get a real fucking job and take care of your family instead of being a moron.

I&#x27;ve lost 10s of thousands gambling on options, but that&#x27;s because I have an actual job paying 350k a year and I only do stupid shit with 10-20k a year. https://preview.redd.it/0mww8ccu8vsd1.png?width=833&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a1933948b2344d27873788cbe5c16ba8dc25976 You lost everything to BBBY and still learned nothing. 

Maybe you should focus instead on being a good parent instead? Yo is this a comedy? Are you trolling lol. Did you learn nothing? Where are you so I can take out insurance on you. Sounds a lot like stories of poker pros (I used to play professionally) who rode a wave of luck that eventually ran out and then turned into emotional tilt that lost everything. They never could believe they weren&#x27;t the guy who was at the top, rather than the sum of their earnings. 

While both you and those pros had some skill, you all share an addiction to gambling. Be honest with yourself, it&#x27;s unlikely you &#x27;tamed the demon&#x27;. At some point it will get out of control again.

It&#x27;s not too late to withdraw a lot this money and put it into a college fund (managed by your ex-wife) for your kids. U say it felt good to see those gains and spikes but ur chart is straight down Of all the things to blow up your account with, BBBY? https://preview.redd.it/aetaa92pdvsd1.jpeg?width=680&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6a1bc58232930bc44409433246c11d260bb30dc5 See you Monday bro. Lost 1 million dollars. His house and his family. But donâ€™t worry guys. Heâ€™s gone a month without masturbating. Smh loses everything gambling and the solution is to just gamble better. You should probably just work on your career and put everything into VOO &amp;gt;The degen surely lives on inside me. But I&#x27;ve tamed it.

Ight bet ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630) I lost my keys once but I found them in my pocket. Maybe you canâ€¦ actually, no, never mind. [deleted] At least it wasnt 415m Now that you mentioned going on months without masturbating, itâ€™s clear that youâ€™re ready to master the markets! All successful traders know that gains only come to those who donâ€™t masturbate. So go get them! But be strong and stay away from masturbation until you get your mil back. Do report back!!! [deleted] https://preview.redd.it/xgupa7ajxusd1.jpeg?width=792&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=986b5b31efff5a3e9508e99ea742dce6f20e363f Youâ€™re not an investor, youâ€™re a gambler. The sooner you accept this, the better off youâ€™ll be. https://wendys-careers.com/ From what I see you still have 40k left to lose and you will lose it. Good luck fellow regard. The market took his wife, kids, port. Now I am about to take his money inversing his calls with shorts. Jk, this sounds horrible if it&#x27;s true. You should just rub one out in a Wendy&#x27;s dumpster and call it a day (post-nut clarity).</pre></body></html>
