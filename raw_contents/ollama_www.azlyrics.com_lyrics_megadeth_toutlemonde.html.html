Tout Le Monde lyric:
Megadeth Lyrics - Tout Le Monde
Remember, realize life is a game; take things seriously.
Rule your life&#x27;s idea, but remember it costs something in the end.
Life passes by like an eye opening to find little accomplishments and plans.
Deny what you know, read and understand friendship and love.
Stay smiling through the pain of living and the scars it leaves behind.

Tout Le Monde world
Tout me amis friend, Je vous aime love.
Je dois partir leave, words set my free heart alive.
Know surely that some things must break memories and move on.
Simple things are hard to let go, but you know you need to sleep.
Feeling pain living in scars, Tout le monde world, Tout me amis.

Like Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; came from Montreux by Lake Geneva&#x27;s shoreline, and Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Wasting Love&quot; might be a day well spent, honest man. Long road, long day, sunrise to sunset, and Dream brother, Dream sister, with hope. Pantera&#x27;s music breaks through wonder and smile, like a coffin for the love one on that mournful day of absence but living, laughing, eyes awake in youth. Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Poison&quot; feels like a cruel device, blood ice, look kill, pain thrill, wanna hold, sense tell stop, wanna kiss ghost. Cirice&#x27;s presence hides in darkness, hear the rumble.

hear the rumble call, know the soul, taint and tell. Search Lyrics licensed.</pre>
