(Image via Path of Exile’s “X” Account) With the Rise of the Abyssal League coming soon, choosing the right build is important. Path of Exile 2&#x27;s latest patch, The Third Edict 0.3, brings some significant shifts, empowering previously overlooked skills. The guide here presents five powerful league starters that are perfect for establishing a stronger early economy and efficiently crushing the newest content. These league starters leverage impactful changes from the recent update.

Ancestral Cry Warrior
This build transforms a Warrior into a walking cataclysm. It revolves around the new Forge Hammer skill, where players throw the fiery hammer to ignite enemies. Real magic begins when Warcry is used with the hammer embedded in the ground, causing a massive volcanic explosion. The eruptions create damaging fissures. Ancestral Cry then supercharges the gameplay by generating Glory via ignitions, which are then Ancestrally Boosted. Players can trigger these fissures simply by moving over them, creating a dynamic and devastating playstyle that clears screens with ease.

Hollow Palm Monks now have the revolutionary Keystone—Hollow Palm Technique, allowing them to perform all Quarterstaff attacks with bare hands while amplifying their power. This unique approach offers additional benefits, making unarmed strikes more lethal and effective for league starters in terms of damage and durability.

**THUNDER FIST HALLOW PALM Monk will be S Tier in 0.3 Poe2.**

For the Ascendancy paths, players are provided with two compelling options:
- **Acolyte of Chayula** focuses on chaos damage.
- **Invoker** offers robust elemental enhancements.

Both paths powerfully synergize with the Hollow Palm mechanic at the core, offering flexibility based on one&#x27;s preferred damage type.

**Lightning Arrow Deadeye** is one of the premier choices for ranged dominance. The core skill remains unchanged, but its power is massively amplified by key Ascendancy revisions.

- **Avidity Notable** offers a 50% chance to have an extra Frenzy Charge, up from 30%, enabling incredible damage, uptime, and attack speed.

**Leveling Guide for Lightning Arrow Deadeye - Path of Exile 2.3:**
The projectile system of Deadeye has also been refined.

Players can now use the meta skill to mark multiple targets to chain projectiles instead of two. When paired with critical chance bonuses from passives like Bullseye, this build delivers unparalleled speed and single-target burst.

For Totem Warbringer, totem play has received a power boost and significant quality-of-life improvements. The previous cap on totems has been removed; one can now summon as many as Endurance Charges allow, with each totem costing approximately the same amount. New support gems make generating charges easier.

In Patch 0.0 POE 2, Fissure Totems in Totem Warbringer are an excellent starter choice. The totems now directly scale with the stats of the equipped weapon, dramatically increasing damage potential. Additionally, the Ancestral Warrior Totems&#x27; passive, Answered Call, allows every totem to raise Ancestral Spirit. All these spirits gain attack speed from Dexterity, creating an aggressive and vast army.

Minion enthusiasts will appreciate the latest patch, which optimizes Spirit costs for high-tier Spectres, making them more accessible early on. Many minion types have also received survivability buffs and direct damage enhancements.

It allows the undead army to team up and manage the battlefield from a safer distance. The Witch’s Ascendancies offer distinct advantages. The Infernalist provides stronger damage mitigation and also grants a hound that ignites foes in a larger area. Conversely, the Lich focuses on harnessing Power Charges (both offensive and defensive) and Energy Shields, making the army resilient. These five builds discussed here exemplify Path of Exile 2’s new meta strategic depth. Each leverages specific patch 0.3 changes to offer a smoother and powerful start. Whether you prefer melee, minions, or anything else, the top-tier options provided below are ready for dominating the Rise of the Abyssal league from day one.
