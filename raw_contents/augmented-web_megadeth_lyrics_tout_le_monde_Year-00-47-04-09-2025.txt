Iron Maiden: "Loneliness Long Distance Runner" Lyrics | AZLyrics.com  
Loneliness Long Distance Runner lyrics by Iron Maiden

Tough track, wind and rain beat heart, loud go get loud  
Go till sound rings in head, step, tread, breath  
Determination makes the run stop  
Got to win, got to run till drop  
Pace holds the race, mind gets clear  
Halfway mile ends, dream gets futile  

Run! Run! Loneliness Long Distance Runner, get run course  
Get run, win costs going strong, determined push  
Run! Run! Stile field turn, look heel way ahead  
Field line gets near.

Want glory go reach final stretch ideal trace feel like throw race futile Run Run loneliness long distance runner Run Run loneliness long distance runner Submit Corrections writer(s) Stephen Percy Harris AZLyrics Iron Maiden Lyrics album Time Machine 1986 catch time waste Years Sea Madness Heaven wait Loneliness Long Distance Runner Stranger Strange Land Deja Vu Alexander great like Metallica memory remain Fortune fame Mirror vain go insane memory remain Heavy ring finger wave star deny grave crowd cry tear honor like twisted vine Megadeth ã Tout Le Monde remember realize life game seriously take thing hard rule idea cost life pass eye find.

Tout Le Monde lyric:
Megadeth Lyrics - Tout Le Monde
Remember, realize life is a game; take things seriously.
Rule your life's idea, but remember it costs something in the end.
Life passes by like an eye opening to find little accomplishments and plans.
Deny what you know, read and understand friendship and love.
Stay smiling through the pain of living and the scars it leaves behind.

Tout Le Monde world
Tout me amis friend, Je vous aime love.
Je dois partir leave, words set my free heart alive.
Know surely that some things must break memories and move on.
Simple things are hard to let go, but you know you need to sleep.
Feeling pain living in scars, Tout le monde world, Tout me amis.

Like Deep Purple's "Smoke on the Water" came from Montreux by Lake Geneva's shoreline, and Iron Maiden's "Wasting Love" might be a day well spent, honest man. Long road, long day, sunrise to sunset, and Dream brother, Dream sister, with hope. Pantera's music breaks through wonder and smile, like a coffin for the love one on that mournful day of absence but living, laughing, eyes awake in youth. Alice Cooper's "Poison" feels like a cruel device, blood ice, look kill, pain thrill, wanna hold, sense tell stop, wanna kiss ghost. Cirice's presence hides in darkness, hear the rumble.

hear the rumble call, know the soul, taint and tell. Search Lyrics licensed.

Megadeth: Set the World Afire Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Set the World Afire lyrics by Megadeth:
Want to set the world on fire,
Red flash and cloud, choke the morning sky.
Say come, know no lie from life's die.
Human succumb; time kisses ass goodbye.

End begin, distorted figure walks the street.
1999, weeds grow 'neath my feet, vines entwine.
Bodies melt like candles in the land of time.
Change your fate, leave it late. Arsenal against Megadeth, ride the tide.

come living envy dead racing power come winning stone cast falsehood worldly peace treaty soon cease leave prove human exist maybe soon child bear open fisted live planet smoke bad lethal energy final scene global darken Dig deep pile rubble ruin tower overhead far wide unknown tool World War III Einstein say use rock survivor set world afire survivor set world afire

believe in the bone bear grave, feel the big ole pile of bones Aaah Aaah Aaaaaaaaah as dust rises right to the end. Motorhead's love forever, love forever, until the end tethered back by the wall. Hand asks for a promise, live till I die, change and stay true. Anthrax law year academy like cadet see man hard veins bleed ice speak twice. Judge Dredd breaks suicidal tendencies, institutionalized to try, work the way we want real change. Frustrated like trying hard like time runs out, work the way it should.

Porcupine Tree, "Deadwing," warm soft passing takes precious things held dearer, rifle grey disappears, creep into darkness, make small hours clear. Anthrax: "Devil Knows Best," man brutal and mean deals business, obscene crosses recognized. Son, pull out the right eye. Unexploded ordinance. Megadeth, "Variate," "Tout Le Monde" remembers, realizes life is a serious game, takes things hard, rules ideas that cost life. Pass by with an eye to search for lyrics.

Iron Maiden "Wasted Years" Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Wasted years, coast and gold, seven seas, travelling far.
Wide stranger thing, close my eyes, think of home.
City goes at night, I miss you till you go away.
Heart lies until dying day when I understand.
I waste time searching wasted years, face stand.
Realise what live is, golden years pass in my hands.
Mind gets ease, pain easily finds its way.
Hard days make me want to cry, throw my hands up to the sky.
Understand wasted time, search for wasted years, face stand.

realise live golden year understand waste time search waste years face stand realise live golden year understand waste time search waste years face stand realise live golden year

Ozzy Osbourne shot on Dark Street, stalked in the night. Heard heavy breathing, paid the price. Killed right there, believed it was fate. Voices called inside his head, "Hellelloween wants your life to begin." Pushed through a little form of hope, like going back to school to teach them to think differently. Convinced by Black Sabbath's message that God is dead and darkness fades into light. Faith in his father and brother as Makers, seeking the Savior in the night, blood, conscience, and murder. Searching for a way out of the gloom where he could rise again. Lyrics license included.
