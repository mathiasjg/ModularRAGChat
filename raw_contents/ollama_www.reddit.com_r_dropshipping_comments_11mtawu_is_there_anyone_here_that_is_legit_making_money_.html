I know it doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. So far I have a general store on Shopify. I sell winning products and digital products. I have not made 1 sale yet. I am working on the marketing aspect of all this right now while working a full time job. I just wish I could at least know just one person who is doing this successfully that is NOT a YouTube/TikTok influencer guru. It‚Äôs really hard to tell if they are actually successful in Dropshipping or just making &amp;amp; selling their brand/courses and things like that. I‚Äôd love to chat with someone who is actually successful with all this, and if your kind enough to chat with me directly would love to just learn and network if you have time. Thank you!Completely relatable bro, i started mine a month ago, getting crazy traffic, studying full time masters and doing this to have a sidehustle. Paid my full monthly allowance into getting a decent website, got scammed by someone, paid for ads and till date no sales. It gets super demotivating at times, super annoying seeing all those people coming and not so much as anyone adding my products to the cart. 
At the end now, now i stay up 2 hours extra to teach my self the skills I need to run this so that i dont have to pay anyone, because well I cant hahahaha. 
I am running a 2 product store right now, which seems to be trending but the sales show me otherwise. 
Lets hang in there bro, and hopefully better days ahead üôåüèΩüôåüèΩ I would say yes, totally. It is still a viable option. However, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúget-rich-quick‚Äù scheme. Like any business, success depends on hard work and dedication. You must do your research and find the right products to sell. You must also be prepared to invest in marketing and advertising to reach your target audience. I always recommend focusing on building a community. Probably using social media and growth services such as ascend viral and you‚Äôll be comfortable with your audience to use them as your reliable source of quality traffic for the longest term. Also, you should be prepared to provide excellent customer service to ensure customer satisfaction. I hope you get the help you are searching for. Best of luck. [removed] Hey, Starting an e-commerce business can be a challenging endeavor, whether you&#x27;re selling on giant marketplaces like Amazon and eBay or running your own Shopify store. Beware of YouTubers who make it sound easy to open a Shopify store and start selling by simply following their steps. While it may seem appealing at first, you&#x27;ll soon realize why many of these young entrepreneurs make YouTube channels to showcase their success and million-dollar sales - it&#x27;s not as easy as they make it out to be.  
In my personal opinion, these YouTubers may be making less profit than what they claim, as expenses and marketing strategies can be costly. If your store starts making sales, most of your profits will be eaten up by subscriptions and paid ads to keep the sales flowing. That&#x27;s why these YouTubers start tutorials and learning channels - to be profitable from YouTube as well. Believe me, no one would choose to make YouTube videos if they were already making millions of dollars in sales.  
After going through the steps to set up your store, you&#x27;ll realize how easy it is to open a YouTube channel and teach others how to do dropshipping. However, the sad truth is that there are few options in 2023 to become a successful seller without paying for ads or testing different products. You&#x27;ll need to learn, learn, and learn how to do it for free or with a small budget, and hit the right strategy to succeed. This requires a lot of time and money to test different approaches.  
In the end, starting an e-commerce business is a cool and fun journey that will teach you a lot. However, it&#x27;s hard to predict when you&#x27;ll become profitable after months or even years of hard work and thousands of dollars in investment. If you&#x27;re an entrepreneur at heart and want to start something, this is the cheapest option to invest your time, money, and energy in. Be patient and persistent, and I wish you the best of luck! Yes I am :) I was working at it for a bit. Got many sales with certain products. I was testing many products using paid tiktok ads every week to find my winners dropshipping can barely make good margin. Success seller do a lot more than dropship This year, I have already achieved sales of 2 million, and I am aiming   
for 5 million, which would be a personal record for me. Through my   
experience, I have learned that with the right marketing skills,   
outside-the-box thinking, organizational skills, and the courage to deal  
 with problems, you can sell virtually anything to anyone, and the myth   
of product saturation is just that - a myth. Dropshipping is more of a   
marathon than a sprint, and requires persistent effort over time. But if  
 you devote yourself to it and stay consistent for a period of two   
years, you have the potential to completely transform your life. Hey, could you give us an update? I related to you. I&#x27;ve always want my own business but despite doing my homework I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing. I think you need help from an expert, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. [removed] [removed] I work 7 nights and just starting my dropshipping with Sellvia/alidropship. I can manage as I usually work night shifts. [removed] First of all, what‚Äôs your traffic stats? Do you have visitors? Do they add products to cart? To they reach checkout page? Does checkout work well?
There are lots of possible points besides driving traffic and advertising. I have been trying for many years and my 2 top suggestions is to find fast shipping times, and always brand your products. Create an actual brand. The thing is dropshipping is funny, because people make it sound easy but you must understand, its building an actual business.
