Iron Maiden: "Loneliness Long Distance Runner" Lyrics | AZLyrics.com  
Loneliness Long Distance Runner lyrics by Iron Maiden

Tough track, wind and rain beat heart, loud go get loud  
Go till sound rings in head, step, tread, breath  
Determination makes the run stop  
Got to win, got to run till drop  
Pace holds the race, mind gets clear  
Halfway mile ends, dream gets futile  

Run! Run! Loneliness Long Distance Runner, get run course  
Get run, win costs going strong, determined push  
Run! Run! Stile field turn, look heel way ahead  
Field line gets near.

Want glory go reach final stretch ideal trace feel like throw race futile Run Run loneliness long distance runner Run Run loneliness long distance runner Submit Corrections writer(s) Stephen Percy Harris AZLyrics Iron Maiden Lyrics album Time Machine 1986 catch time waste Years Sea Madness Heaven wait Loneliness Long Distance Runner Stranger Strange Land Deja Vu Alexander great like Metallica memory remain Fortune fame Mirror vain go insane memory remain Heavy ring finger wave star deny grave crowd cry tear honor like twisted vine Megadeth ã Tout Le Monde remember realize life game seriously take thing hard rule idea cost life pass eye find.

Moment Betrayal lyric by Dream Theater:

Gabriel breaks the news,
Brave brother lies tonight.
Noise Machines threaten loss and fear.
Bloodshed, pain, and Ravenskill's near.

Acting strange, on edge, voice changes.
Brother’s strength lost in the storm.

Arhys burns rise  
Secrets sell  
Moment betrayal  
Kiss death  
Blood revenge  
Moment betrayal  
Defenseless look fight witness hero tonight  
burns rise  
Secrets sell  
Moment betrayal  
Kiss death  
Blood revenge  
Moment betrayal  
Threats lie change side  
Moment betrayal risk  
Savior fall  
Moment betrayal

Megadeth "Tout Le Monde Set Free" remember to realize life is a game to be taken seriously, not ruled by a false idea whose cost is your very life. Look with eyes that find meaning in every passing moment. Epica "Essence of Silence" reveals the wrongness in corrupting strength; thoughts and moods can't be controlled like the swing of a pendulum. Believe in the cold night's stand, where the mind walks like a party gone dizzy. Search for lyrics under "license".

Porcupine Tree, "Deadwing," warm soft passing takes precious things held dearer, rifle grey disappears, creep into darkness, make small hours clear. Anthrax: "Devil Knows Best," man brutal and mean deals business, obscene crosses recognized. Son, pull out the right eye. Unexploded ordinance. Megadeth, "Variate," "Tout Le Monde" remembers, realizes life is a serious game, takes things hard, rules ideas that cost life. Pass by with an eye to search for lyrics.

Rocket Queen lyrics by Guns N' Roses:  
Need thing 'cause turn like, turn get tongue like razor sweet switchblade knife favor like.  
Rocket Queen, little young honey be naive.  
Rocket Queen, oh yeah honey, bit obscene see.  
Imaginable pass eye tangible, honey surprised sexual innuendo burn paradise.  
Turn well, turn tonight Rocket Queen.  
Little young honey be naive.  
Rocket Queen, oh yeah honey, bit obscene.

Little, young honey, be naive, Rocket Queen oh yeah.
Honey, bit obscene, standin' standin' lonely place, need shoulder, need friend.
Stand at the bitter end, need sorrow, need pain, hate walking in the rain.
Chastise think mean harm, leave, string far.
Baby yeah, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh baby yeah.
Leave, want to know care.

Crazy like Rocket Queen, Black Sabbath, Grave Revolution; mind-melting starts and marches across the world. Live in hate, hearts tired, push to tell—Aerosmith's "Dude (Look Out for That Train)." 

Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga, Cruise by the bar shore, picture grace under grime. Iron Maiden, "2 Minutes to Midnight," kill and gain, shoot and maim; a need for reason.

Golden Goose, loose in season, blacken pride, burn inside like a shell. Bloody treason, guns aimed. Feelgood Rat Tail Jimmy, second-hand deals, Hollywood gets 65 Chevy primers to flame trade powder good. Jigsaw's Jimmy game, hear do.

Got a. Megadeth "Tout Le Monde" remember to realize life is a serious game and take things seriously. It's a rule we must follow, an idea that has cost us much in our lives but passes like a fleeting glance. Find the lyrics [here](https://www.lyrics.com/Megadeth+-+Tout_Le_Monde_Lyrics).

Avenged Sevenfold lyrics: M.
Stare carnage, pray for sun rise,
Live each day, disguise feeling right.
Lend me courage to stand and fight tonight.
Ooooo, stand and fight against raging challenges.
Strong in our walk, find our land and belong.
Millions of soldiers, fighting the wrong, seeking fun far from home.
Fight war, find our way, picture what we want well.
Scared of killing, but seek fun and shoot for what is right.
Mother, son, erase consciousness, dream of honor.
Fight for life, pray to God, right or wrong.
Win or lose, let home fill with mother's tears.
Grow fast in years, memories will let us cry return tonight.

Soldier life: Scared alive by murder; know and tell reasons for fighting; weapon in hand; fear consumes every day. Life is real fight; honor binds it all together. Pray to God for right path; hope to win but accept loss; yearn for home and mother. Tears fill eyes, yet they grow fast; memories let one cry tonight as they stare at carnage. Pray that the sun rises, live another day, even if it is a disguise of feeling right. Lend me courage to stand and fight; watch death toll rise but wonder how I am still alive among strangers' blood on my hands. Shot by shot, night turns silent; watch brother die, plan for tomorrow's carnage, thoughts swirling in endless loops. Ohhhhh.

Time Owes Me Good I. Megadeth ã Tout Le Monde Remember to Realize Life's Game Seriously and Take Things Lightly. Don't Rule Out Ideas That Could Cost You Everything. Live Your Life Through Eyes That Find Skin, Paint Pictures, and Wish to Look Like Maybe Feeling an Ounce of Pain Will Help You Focus. Step into the Shadow, Face Battles and Need with Black Tide Fire. Tell Your Story, Feel the Rambling Fire Within Time, Blind to Thought but Lost in Mind, Take a Search Through Lyrics for License.
