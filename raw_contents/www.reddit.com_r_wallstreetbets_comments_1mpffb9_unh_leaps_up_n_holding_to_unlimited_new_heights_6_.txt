[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) Holding 200 shares at average cost of 278.24 - DCA'ing every day (25 bucks a day) - and selling covered calls. LFG Congrats bro! Good pick, and this is the insane cherry on top Have some too, Hoping Buffet adds this tomorrow. will pay nicely :)) [deleted] Last thursday I was looking at UNH and bought 2 minutes before close. Clearly I timed the bottom &amp; I'm liking how the UPNL looked. So... I maxed out this account. Timing the market is better than time in the market

Goodluck to all Well done sir! Exercise! You actually know what you're doing compared to everyone who spent their last penny when it dipped to $380 after the CEO quit. So respect and congrats on the trade. Would love to hear your thoughts on the short-term direction, I bought some at a cost basis of about 245 and sold the 270 call which I am now regretting. Should I wait for it to drop a bit after I'm exercised out, or get back in right away? I think a lot of morons have been buying the stock which makes me think there's still downside, plus the pattern has been Bad News -&gt; Stock drops -&gt; Moron buying pushes it partially back up -&gt; More bad news, repeat. Thoughts? Yes! Letâ€™s get on this runn Waluigi I don't get it.

134 calls with $66 average price. That's 440k margin required to stay in the trade.

What are you hoping for the underlying will be worth? Let's say 500 just for giggles. So the total value of the investment would be 1.3m. That translates into a ~31% annualized rate of return.

That's seems like a lot of concentrated risk and capital lock-up for only OK returns, no? [deleted] Congrats on another $180k this evening. This is my tiny (because I'm poor) UNH position opened today. I might keep adding until it reaches $300 ahead of October's earnings and sell before that. I don't think the stock will go up more than $300 before earnings at least
