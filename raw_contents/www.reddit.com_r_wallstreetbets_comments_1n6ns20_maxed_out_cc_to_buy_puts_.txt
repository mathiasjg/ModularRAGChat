Maybe it's time you re-evaluated your life's decisions. This will end in three different ways:
 
- You take profits and stop making dumb choices
- You hold, NVDA recovers and you lose it all
- You hold, NVDA dumps more, you get cocky from winning big and do more risky bets and lose it all

Going into debt to make short term bets that has a high risk of getting wiped out is exactly what will put you behind Wendy’s dumpster Sell it, before market turn around and f*ck your position It’s crazy how OP posted at the absolute bottom. Congrats to those who inverted OP 🎉🍾

Pay your credit card and then run some scissors through it. You won a lottery. If you wan to be degenerate, take 50% of your gains and go at it, but please don’t be in high interest debt for this. Got my calls! We feast! Thanks OP Hold it as long as you can You don't get a lotta reward without a lotta risk! I bought 15 shares of NVDA when it was low today because of your post. Thanks. Even if you win, you're just going to keep YOLOing until you lose it all. So, what's the point? 😄 I hope you sold😭 Bad timing lol You shoulda sold early today 1-800-dave-Ramsey..... hahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. RemindMe! 2 Days You’re 50% regarded by maxing your CC don’t go full 100 regarded and sell and payoff cc


Or be full 150% regarded and wait for a 10x Op ate shut unless he sold yesterday. Today position is downalmost half NVIDIA is a Short? I read it as maxed out covered calls to buy puts and thought it was a new strategy like put calls. Market bounced hard off SPX 6360. This is likely the bottom and we will see dip buyers coming back in. 

You are likely already negative on this trade and didn’t have a stop loss in place. Wall St bros would like to thank you for your donation. Better start marking this as a loss well well well Excited for update in morning Believe it or not calls Update; I inversed OP and bought 172.5c 3DTE and sold this morning at 10:30AM for $200 per contract so sorry OP regard, can we get an update.  Even I cash in on my PUTs, and they were even weeklies. Hahaha so many people wishing other to lose money is crazy worked. I hope you win my bois! 10x baggers I mean this is a risk reversal and a completely legitimate hedging strategy to manage risk used by hedged funds…

You’re on the wrong fucking sub bud. The puts confuse me - for break even points in puts does that mean that if the stock price is that price or LOWER they make money? smart move
