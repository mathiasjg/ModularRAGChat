[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) I have no idea what you just said I&#x27;m happy for you though or sorry that happened i will personally drop the stock to $179 tomorrow and early exerciseÂ  Pay attention regards, this is how you get margin called Personally I think this is a good move, maybe not for WSB since in their mind a 50% return over 2 years is boring, but a good move regardless. Iâ€™m DCAing in UNH because they print cash but seeing all of the doom and gloom on here about the company is making me even more optimistic. Always inverse reddit Iâ€™m not against this trade. Worst case, UNH fails and youâ€™re stuck with this thing but I find this extremely unlikely. Why not buy back your position if this goes up to $300+? Unless youâ€™re committed to seeing all theta released or different tax classification. Post this to theta gang. They love this type of totally not leveraged shit lmao I personally think this is great.  UNH as much as I hate em and want to go bankrupt. Theyâ€™ll be fine after all this dust settles. Iâ€™m sitting on a few $350 calls $1/16/27 and down over 70% but will be fine. Jesus 43% IV on a boomer stock 2027 exp is actually really expensive

This is a good play the premium is basically pricing in an apocalypse Tying up a lot of money for 2 years Youâ€™re a sitting duck for liquidity is what you are The only thing good about Schwab is selling options using collateral doesnâ€™t cost interest 

Schwab is my theta account, I do all long options on hood How do you sleep at night ðŸ˜­ Real men go naked! BIG SACK BIG REWARD. I must remember this post when it hits below $150 next week All the best, personally I think its a good play. Insurance ain&#x27;t going anywhere no matter what the news are saying. Doomers gonna doom. Good luck. I would be mind blown if this doesnâ€™t work. good luck bro 10m+ I don&#x27;t see the strategy of selling short on a company in trouble? What could go wrong in this company? Everything is already in trouble. That carries over to your strategy. 
If you do this in a technology company, you never lose. They may not go up but they never go down. Why did it go from $600 to $200 in weeksâ€¦.? Itâ€™s not the early assignment or dropping to 180 dollars. Itâ€™s volatility that can crush you. The margin requirement on this naked put can dramatically increase if volatility goes nuts. You might be right - but can you hold the position through the craziness for will Schwab liquidate you? Does level 4 margin give you 4x your buying power?

  
I actually don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad of an idea but bagholding $1.2 million of UNH is a lot. if you get assigned, you need $1M. This trade is cash money I just don&#x27;t see why you would bet on a looser stock. It&#x27;s like choosing the horse that goes last, it won&#x27;t lose the same race twice. But he won&#x27;t win either Insurance is the biggest rip off in the universe. Fuck those guys !remindme 1 year You sold a naked put.  You should never pay interest on that.  They took in cash for the sale. you have bigger balls than i do Youâ€™re early.  Look at the chart. u be fine unless unh hits 160 I wouldnâ€™t worry about it. Unless it goes well below $160 youâ€™re probably safe, you can always roll them down and out if you get into trouble. People here dont understand how margin works. 

He is tying up POTENTIAL buying power to get credit NOW. If he gets early assigned he buys unh at 180 on borrowed money. He then pays interest on the loaned amount for as long he has the position open. He doesn&#x27;t even need to liquidate to cover if his other positions dont drop dramatically if he gets early assignment. Selling long dated puts is basically the same as buying a deep ITM LEAP call but you get your money upfront and miss on future upside. good luck man. Cash secured puts by definition aren&#x27;t naked. Good luck! I donâ€™t think you understand how much a stock can go down. This isnâ€™t just a cyclical change for UNH, policies are changing and the government is involved. Broâ€™s too smart for this subreddit Almost never worth it to sell to open long dated puts like that 

You&#x27;re better off selling monthly puts and keep rolling !RemindMe 1 year [deleted] . What do you have to do to get margin on Schwab? Holy shit balls Sounds like
A
Good bet gl My man is about the LONG GAME How do you not pay interest on naked puts? Is that a feature for all Schwab accounts or do you have a special deal with your account? Working the wheel. Feeling the flow. [deleted] What levels of margin with the bank OP! This will keep me up at night for the next two years!</pre></body></html>
