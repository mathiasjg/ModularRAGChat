Well as the owner of an AI Agency based in Australia, im going to tell you EXACLY what skills you will need if you are going to make money from AI Agents - and I can promise you that most of you will be surprised by the skills required!  

I say that because whilst you do need some basic understanding of how ML works and what AI Agents can and can&#x27;t do, really and honestly the skills you actually need to make money and turn your hobby in to a money machine are NOT programming or Ai skills!!  Yeh I can feel the shock washing over your face right now.. Trust me though, Ive been running an AI Agency since October last year (roughly) and Ive got direct experience.  

**Alright so let&#x27;s get to the meat and bones then, what skills do you need?**

1. You need to be able to code (yeh not using no-code tools) basic automations and workflows. And when I say &quot;you need to code&quot; what I really mean is, You need to know how to prompt Cursor (or similar) to code agents and workflows.  Because if your serious about this, you aint gonna be coding anything line by line - you need to be using AI to code AI. 

2. Secondly you need to get a pretty quick grasp of what agents CANT do.  Because if you don&#x27;t fundamentally understand the limitations, you will waste an awful amount of time talking to people about sh\*t that can&#x27;t be built and trying to code something that is never going to work.  

Let me give you an example. I have had several conversations with marketing businesses who have wanted me to code agents to interact with messages on LInkedin. It can&#x27;t be done, Linkedin does not have an API that allows you to do anything with messages.  YES Im aware there are third party work arounds, but im not one for using half measures and other services that cost money and could stop working.  So when I get asked if i can build an Ai Agent that can message people and respond to LinkedIn messages - its a straight no - NOW MOVE ON... Zero time wasted for both parties.  

Learn about what an AI Agent can and can&#x27;t do. 

**Ok so that&#x27;s the obvious out the way, now on to the skills YOU REALLY NEED** 

3. People skills!  Yeh you need them, unless you want to hire a CEO or sales person to do all that for you, but assuming your riding solo, like most is us, like it not you are going to need people skills.  You need to a good talker, a good communicator, a good listener and be able to get on with most people, be it a technical person at a large company with a PHD, a solo founder with no tech skills, or perhaps someone you really don&#x27;t intitially gel with , but you gotta work at the relationship to win the business. 

4. Learn how to adjust what you are explaining to the knowledge of the person you are selling to.  But like number 3, you got to qualify what the person knows and understands and wants and then adjust your sales pitch, questions, delivery to that persons understanding. Let me give you a couple of examples:

* Linda, 39, Cyber Security lead at large insurance company. Linda is VERY technical.  Thus your questions and pitch will need to be technical, Linda is going to want to know how stuff works, how youre coding it, what frameworks youre using and how you are hosting it (also expect a bunch of security questions).
* b) Frank, knows jack shi\*t about tech, relies on grandson to turn his laptop on and off.  Frank owns a multi million dollar car sales showroom.  Frank isn&#x27;t going to understand anything if you keep the disucssions technical, he&#x27;ll likely switch off and not buy.  In this situation you will need to keep questions and discussions focussed on HOW this thing will fix his problrm.. Or how much time your automation will give him back hours each day.  &quot;Frank this Ai will save you 5 hours per week, thats almost an entire Monday morning im gonna give you back each week&quot;.   

5. Learn how to price (or value) your work.  I can&#x27;t teach you this and this is something you have research yourself for your market in your country.  But you have to work out BEFORE you start talking to customers HOW you are going to price work. Per dev hour?  Per job?  are you gonna offer hosting? maintenance fees etc?  Have that all worked out early on, you can change it later, but you need to have it sussed out early on as its the first thing a paying customer is gonna ask you - &quot;How much is this going to cost me?&quot;

6. Don&#x27;t use no-code tools and platforms. Tempting I know, but the reality is you are locking yourself (and the customer) in to an entire eco system that could cause you problems later and will ultimately cost you more money.  EVERYTHING and more you will want to build can be built with cursor and python.  Hosting is more complexed with less options. what happens of the no code platform gets bought out and then shut down, or their pricing for each node changes or an integrations stops working???   CODE is the only way.

7.  Learn how to to market your agency/talents.  Its not good enough to post on Facebook once a month and say &quot;look what i can build!!&quot;.  You have to understand marketing and where to advertise.  Im telling you this business is good but its bloody hard.  HALF YOUR BATTLE IS EDUCATION PEOPLE WHAT AI CAN DO.   Work out how much you can afford to spend and where you are going to spend it. 

If you are skint then its door to door, cold calls / emails. But learn how to do it first.  Don&#x27;t waste your time. 

8. Start learning about international trade, negotiations, accounting, invoicing, banks, international money markets, currency fluctuations, payments, HR, complaints.........  I could go on but im guessing many of you have already switched off!!!! 

  
THIS IS NOT LIKE THE YOUTUBERS WILL HAVE YOU BELIEVE.  &quot;Do this one thing and make $15,000 a month forever&quot;.  It&#x27;s BS and click bait hype. Yeh you might make one Ai Agent and make a crap tonne of money - but I can promise you, it won&#x27;t be easy.  And the 99.999% of everything else you build will be bloody hard work.  

My last bit of advise is learn how to detect and uncover buying signals from people.  This is SO important, because your time is so limited.  If you don&#x27;t understand this you will waste hours in meetings and chasing people who wont ever buy from you.  You have to weed out the wheat from the chaff.  Is this person going to buy from me?  What are the buying signals, what is their readiness to proceed?

It&#x27;s a great business model, but its hard. If you are just starting out and what my road map, then shout out and I&#x27;ll flick it over on DM to you. I‚Äôd say the most important thing is to actually understand how businesses run, what different departments actually do, and how teams interface with each other.

I see that most ‚Äòagents‚Äô being built today, are mostly built by people that have very little understanding of how   businesses are run. 

And honestly unless anyone has spent considerable time in the guts of businesses you will not understand this, unless you have an actual MBA.

Coding is the least important aspect, if you have deep domain knowledge of businesses and genuinely know how you can legitimately automate processes that are useful to the end user, then you can use an llm to get you most of the way, or pay a software developer. 

I‚Äôve spent 25 years working in finance and ops, for businesses all over the world, and I can tell you that finding people that understand how processes and systems (not just saas actual strategy and execution) work or should work is a very rare thing. 

IMO this is what is holding up mass adoption of agentic tech in businesses, it‚Äôs not the tech is the misunderstanding or lack of domain knowledge by the people building the tech. [deleted] Great advice: I‚Äôm in the GRC arena and the adoption of AI in corporate workspace in addition to experimentation by employees on home and work systems is challenging to ensure the safety of one‚Äôs PII.  Having worked through different roles and business units during my career makes it easier to understand how and what to prompt so one can have better interactions with AI Agents.  

Like the vast majority, I‚Äôm no expert and still learning everyday. Very interested in your road map.  Thanks Really appreciate you spelling out what it takes. Most people just talk about tools but miss the real business and people skills. Do you think there is any shortcut to learning how to sell and talk to clients, or is it just trial and error? The emphasis on communication abilities over technical prowess is spot on. This is a great, no-nonsense post. The point about people skills being more important than programming is so true in the agency world. The real money is in solving problems and building trust, not just coding. Hi, would you mind sharing the roadmap with me? im just starting out Appreciate sharing this. Would love to get that roadmap.. Tips on what frameworks to learn? Do I need to master lang chain and lang graph or is it possible to rely on other similar frameworks like Google ADK or pydantic Good advice indeed. Need to learn faster is the skill in itself! Lost me on _‚Äùdon‚Äôt use no code‚Äù_. I made real money with n8n as my main backend tool. I would love your road map üôè Your road map please üôèüèº Would love to have the roadmap please. üëç Your road map please Hey mate! Could you please share the roadmap with me? I‚Äôm confident on the technical side and consistently work on sharpening my skills, but after reading your views, I realized that what‚Äôs holding me back is my limited understanding of the business aspect of AI agents.

My goal is to not only build AI agents but also successfully sell them, and for that I need to understand and equipped on both fronts - technical and business. It would mean a lot if you could share your perspective and provide me with a roadmap to help navigate the learning curve. Hey- Everything you said was on point. I am in the beginning phase of my learning journey. Would love to see that roadmap! Thanks. Here for the roadmap... I would love to checkout your roadmap. Thank you. Hey thank you for sharing your experiences, can I have copy of your road map and anything else that can kick start me straight away :-) thanks again I&#x27;d love your roadmap too! Thanks a lot Hey, I love this! As someone building in the AI space, this is ACTUALLY insightful! WOuld love to get a hold of your roadmap! Thanks in advace :) i feel like a lot of businesses have absolutely no idea how these agents work so they are scared to waste money on them, thanks for this post it was heplful Roadmap please! Hey mate! Could you please share the roadmap with me? I WANT YOUR ROAD MAP!! This is probably one of the  most honest breakdown I‚Äôve seen on here. The ‚ÄúAI agency‚Äù game is way closer to running a scrappy consultancy than sitting in a lab coding models. I‚Äôm always sceptical of people ‚Äúeducating‚Äù people on how to do what they do. Why would you be telling people how to do what you can do? It‚Äôs counterproductive to capitalism Thank you for your submission, for any questions regarding AI, please check out our wiki at https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki (this is currently in test and we are actively adding to the wiki)

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AI_Agents) if you have any questions or concerns.* I would love your roadmap! Thanks for the tips Would love the roadmap, thanks ! The emphasis on communication abilities over technical prowess is spot on. Sounds fair enough! I would love to have the roadmap, please. Am I right to assume that you are in B2B business? And not building agent for end consumers? Need the map Please hook me up with the road map i have some questions I am very interested in rod map, thanks in advance üôÇ wow i read your entire message it&#x27;s like eye opening for me i got different perspective on ai agents as you mentioned in the message can you give me a roadmap so i can learn to that stuff by the way thank you for sharing you wonderful thoughts. do me a favour an advertise some where else, cretin [removed] Hi, can I please get a quote from you to build me an AI agent that finds specific info online and emails me the details in a newsletter or Excel file fortnightly. I can give you the variables and some of the websites but will need the AI to search Australian and international info. Or please direct me to your business email address. Looking for a one-off product rather than an ongoing collaboration. Thank you Honestly, what stood out to me from all of this is how much the business and people side matters. You can build the slickest AI agent, but if you don‚Äôt understand the customer‚Äôs problem or how their business actually works, it won‚Äôt earn a dime.

For anyone starting out, here‚Äôs a practical approach that helped me:

1. **Start small with a workflow you actually care about.** Even something like automating a report or helping with code review in your IDE teaches you the essentials.
2. **Learn the limits.** Understand what AI agents can and cannot do. Trying to build something impossible wastes time and kills momentum.
3. **Layer in basic business skills.** Talking to people, understanding their needs, pricing your work‚Äîthese are the skills that pay off more than perfect code at the beginning.
4. **Iterate publicly if possible.** Share prototypes with a small audience, get feedback, learn fast. That‚Äôs how you go from ‚Äútoy project‚Äù to something people actually pay for.

The tech is important, but context and execution are what actually turn an agent into revenue. I&#x27;d love your roadmap! Also starting out and having zero luck. So for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t wants to go much into coding but wanna pursue the world of Agentic AI, which skills really are required in terms of coding? I&#x27;ve been vibe coding a lot but can&#x27;t completely rely on this on the note of not knowing actual coding at all! I make a solid 6 figures, i know Python, but the most valuable AI Agent integrated workflows have been through Microsoft Power Automate.
