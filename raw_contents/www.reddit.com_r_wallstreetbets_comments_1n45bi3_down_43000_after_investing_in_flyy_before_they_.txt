my previous post got removed as i didn’t have a screenshot of my portfolios, before u ask if i’m regarded, yes i am. i’m a degenerate at heart and i thought i saw potential in making wife changing amounts of moolah. i thought surely it can’t get worst than a 2nd bankruptcy and assumed it would be bought out by a company but no these fuckers are down so bad nobody wants to touch their shitty company

so now i’m holding on for dear life, mama ain’t raise no bitch 💪💪💪💪💪

[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**⚔**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCave/) Take the 17k out and invest elsewhere before *you’re* bankrupt, friend &gt; down -$43,000 after investing in $FLYY before they filed for a 2nd bankruptcy this year

‘investing’, lulz What do you mean BEFORE the 2nd bankruptcy? Wasn't the 1st one a sign not to buy in? Narratator: "Momma, did in fact, raise a bitch" It’s unrealized so as long as they don’t realize. All good, isn’t that how it works? This is more regarded than 0DTEs

I don’t think Wendy’s would even risk hiring you with such bad decision making. Best you can probably do is a greeter at a theme park. Should’ve bought frontier instead Never buy airline shares or options.  Too regulated according to Buffett. When will you learn after the next bankruptcy Kind of crazy to me that they relisted and then just went straight down. I think they didn’t really have plan or much hope. But wanted to get whatever money they could raise. https://preview.redd.it/9xawncsnv6mf1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e92796f14d2988085f903aec812d405c216e8197 Fucking retard. Why buy a company that had just gone bankrupt?? Thank you regard for a vulture has found its prey at last Only a degen would be this devoted to hodling $FLYY. You most certainly belong here. odds of a 3rd in one year and probably low ------- good time to DCA and wait a short squeeze ...................









  
/s Should invest in the memecoin on pumpfun,
Their goal is to flip the stock price. Take that 17K and Buy $FLYY on Solana flip the market cap of spirit 😂 Dude, RIP ur wallets 💀 Investing is a fickle beast, ain't it? Well i can immediately see that your problem was that you didnt make those WIFE changing decisions carefully enough.  Dont be a Will Smith. The difference between amateur traders and professionals is that professional traders manage their risk and cut losses quickly. Read John Carter’s mastering the trade. You’re literally the TASR example in the book right now. I’ve been there too. You’re a victim of market dynamics right now with no professional education or mindset. With this mindset you will sell at lows when the pain is too great before it rallies. And another trader will have shorted your original position and then gone long at the bottom when it bounces. Professional trading is about utilizing good setups not trying to make money. They're trying to flip the stock on Solana memecoin, just flip it back bro

What made you choose this stock? I see nothing in the FLYY chart that looks appealing. Looks like $FLYY did $CRASHH before even taking off You're not investing, you're gambling How do we trade options on this one??? Sell and put everything in $FLY Double down before the 3rd bankruptcy. Of all the sectors, why airlines? Of all the airlines, why gamble on a buyout of this PoS? Plenty of reasonable investment alternatives, but people still need to go deep into these obscure ventures and keep burning their hands on these hot stoves. "we are aware of some missing data in portfolios" --------- yeah $43,000.00 worth !! Ouch Now why would you invest in Spirit after they went bankrupt this year already 🙂‍↕️ 😂 Their weekly chart is just red dashes straight down. Why would this make you think it’s a good idea to full port? You were down 43k before they filed for bankruptcy
