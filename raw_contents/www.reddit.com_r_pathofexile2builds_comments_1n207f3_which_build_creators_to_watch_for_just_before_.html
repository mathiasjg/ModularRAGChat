Mathil, he creates proof of concept builds successfully for most classes, some thrive, some are mid. He has a YouTube video for every build he puts out. 

He also always goes in hard on all the new content league to league. Jungroan for insane knowledge but he hates dumb questions on stream so be prepared. For casual watching/good vibes, I would do Aer0 or CaptainLance9 or Mathil. 

Pick a class or something to play and watch the streamer that plays your build, it&#x27;s so cool to watch someone go on the same journey as you. Goratha and Jungroan are my favorite because they try to come up with new ideas often. Whoever you watch just make sure it&#x27;s not Quin, unless you want 0 understanding of anything, not just the game. avoid ghazzy for minions. that whiny dude will just bait you with unoptimized build that rely on expensive items and still under deliver. look at oscrix instead Goratha, waggle, Phaze. I find Palesteon, CaptainLance, Mathil and Jungroan are really capable at both PoE 1 and 2 at making unique builds that leverage new/changed mechanics.

For either PoE 1&amp;amp;2, Dreamcore and Sirgog offer the most comprehensive information about the game

For new players, Zizaran is pretty good Otherwise Zizarin is a good conduit of other peoples build ideas as he gives them exposure on YouTube. Lazy Exile makes good builds and guides that worked for me in the past. I might follow her on her tactician ballista banner start.

I would like to go WH but going blind would be probably bad. Sirgog, Dreamcore. There are a lot of PoE1 streamers who don&#x27;t yet have a good understanding of PoE2 because they bailed on v0.2 very quickly, so I don&#x27;t want to shout them out necessarily.

For PoE2 specifically, some lesser known folks doing a good job: Ulfrednar, KalTorak, Jorgen, Ignatius, UncleJay, Skadoosh.

For people who have a _balanced perspective_ and consistently present good information: Mathil of course, and aer0.

Some of the other big names are cocky and not actually knowledgeable about PoE2 and/or are trying a bit too hard to pump maxroll/mobalytics. AnimePrincess. dude is so willing to help you with his builds My fave is Alkazier, he doesnt answer questions or do explanations or anything but just from watching him play its clear he has a very deep understanding of the game&#x27;s systems. Learned quite a bit from just watching. He will sometimes explain stuff, like when he was reforging last league he explained how base-swapping worked and stuff. Idk if I consider him a &quot;build creator&quot; as much as a guy who just plays and makes builds, if you know what I mean.

KallTorak is also really good and makes good content so I wanna shout him out, but hes mostly (not entirely) Thorns/reflect builds so if thats not your cup of tea idk. Stick to captain lance / Palsteron for good build and possibility of asking questions.

Jungroan is good build creator but LOVES to overblow any negative, is fine with very clunky piano mechanics and you will never get any answer.

Fubgun same build every league but too focused on game and will never help you.

Mathil if you want fun build, advice but do not care about meta.

Onemanaleft is very fun person to listen to has good builds that are niche but if you ask question you will probably be banned.

Spicysushi for very interesting craft / trade advice good music and vibes  but he will just roll the most meta build

Avoid quin69 as he actively tries to make his own character bad for fun. I guess it takes knowledge to do that too tho.. ruetoo cause he makes builds for peasants/stupid people

he makes builds that have a lot of leeway, work with mostly cheap uniques, making things easy to start with, but also generally have a lot of scaling potential if you are willing to invest later on Depends on what u want at the end. Just in general ruetoo and jungroan are great, I would also like to mention fubgun and oscrix (especially if u r interested in minion builds) Nugi has some interesting ideas Ruetoo, his current* builds always good and easy to follow from 0 to 100.



*those builds also always got tripple tap nerf, gutted, or just simply deleted by GGG in next league. Lazyexile cooks with an eye on economy. These are the creators I trust with their builds, who also make decent guides and updates through league start:

[MilkyBk](https://youtube.com/@milkybk_) - Specifically for Monk

[Fubgun](https://youtube.com/@fubgun) - Deadeye, usually plays meta build

[Goratha](https://youtube.com/@goratha) - Makes interesting builds

[CaptainLance](https://youtube.com/@captainlance9) - Pretty advanced videos sometimes that require knowledge about the game to follow My goto is Goratha and Zizaran. I think Zizaran has become a bit to big in the streamerspace even tho I think he deserves it, the quality has gone down. Goratha is such a happy chill guy can’t go wrong with his great guides. He’s probably lesser viewed because he ain’t on camera.

Edit: honorable mention phaze. 
Rue probably but he is acting like an infant with the profanity and screams and it doesn’t vibe with me.

I play only group ssf with 2 others in private leagues so their guides suits me perfectly too. Ruetoo, Jungroan, Goratha, \_Ben and Palsteron are my goto when it comes to POE in general.

Zizaran and CrunchyTuna are also someone I would recommend for new players too, as they will explain to you a lot about the game.

Ruetoo is my favorite out of all. He has very deep knowledge about the game, and when he theorycraft you could understand a lot more about mechanic interactions. Also most of his builds are very achievable

Ps: Rue is a cat I&#x27;ve honestly had awful experiences with PoE content creators, they dont really know what new players are lacking when it comes to understanding builds so its really easy to end up screwing up a build especially a more complicated one when it comes to gearing.

My best PoE experience has been following the Maxroll guides, their checklist system is really great for knowing what gear and stats to prioritise! Ronarray makes solid builds, Goratha also Anyone to watch if I wanna play storm weaver? I feel not many interested in that ascendancy. Wild there is no mention of Onemanaleft / ConnerConverse

He has essentially made/refined the strongest builds in both PoE1 and PoE2 every league for the last few years at least.

His understanding of every scaling vector allows for combinations that routinely break the game and end up being patched out the next league.

Personally I take his concepts and simplify them for QoL of gameplay. Might not hit billions in dps or infinite ehp as he does, but still end up with a top tier all-rounder build.

Edit: The question isn&#x27;t &quot;who is the nicest PoE creator&quot;. It was who is really good at understanding the game. Good luck with your surface level deadeye builds that top out at 6k ehp. I like Kingdom Twelve for his mercenary content and explanations on exactly why certain support gems can and cannot work for certain skills and use cases.
Also think he started doing warrior content recently too.
I haven&#x27;t been able to watch much recently due to being bust but I will be available for 0.3 so I&#x27;m excited to see if the tactician is back on his radar. Ben. He is winning every race , just to understand his level of knowledge and skill. depends which version of the game you are playing, trade league, ssf league, trade hardcore, ssfhc they are all very different from each other I am surprised no1 mentions Kripp. none Im suprised Fubgun and Ronarray are hardly mentioned in this post I focus on the league ladder rushers who play on the hardest difficulty and then replicate their work in easier play modes. it&#x27;s the only way to be sure I didn&#x27;t miss something silly like &quot;spend a mirror for this slot or the build will never click&quot; piggybacking on this: who is the best to watch for a new player? i.e who is the best at explaining the thought process and underlying mechanics so i can actually learn about buildcrafting? OneManaLeft has been super good for key owledge for me. Just be warned he can be a little salty sometimes Ulfhednar has helped me tremendously with understandimg the game. Unique ideas too Piotr Maciejczak from channel PiotrMaciejczak Chap called Lokati is good to watch.  You can post him your pob and get help with your build etc via twitch.  I enjoy his no bs, middle aged guy approach and him showing people in real time on stream how he fixes their build and why Any recommendations for Chronomancer?  It was my favourite build in 0.1, but I couldn&#x27;t get it working on 0.2. idk what other people suggest here and there is probably a lot of good ones but the biggest 5heads that frequently come up with new and off meta stuff and think outside the box are  jungroan and goratha My money is on Jungroan. The problem is, his builds tend to be high-floor and high-ceiling types and thus not quite easy to get going. For more practical builds, CaptainLance9 and Fubgun are great. Just remember for every 1 good build creator there are 4 or 5 more people who are ready to grief the fuck out of your league run because they have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about but say whatever the fuck anyway Unironically ruetoo, the cat played poe2 way more than most poe1 players, and his builds are just good, in both games I&#x27;ve really never gone wrong with Waggle or Goratha builds. Definitely not quin69 I know hes a love or hate character but Ruetoo always makes quality builds that he follows through with great guides Jungroan, Captain Lance, Fubgun (always bows) and Goratha. This is just what I think, there are many other good creators Alkaizer is smart, he probably won&#x27;t answer questions during streams but it&#x27;s a nice combination of strong foundational understanding of the game + usually plays more straightforward and easy to understand build concepts Plasteron because his accent makes me chuckle. Good builds too if you’re a build follower I suppose.</pre></body></html>
