It seems to look like with XP/minion buff/structure changes we get extra call to make what is best in given moment, with more choice there is room to make good calls or bad ones. Example:

An offlaner today in early levels will:
- just double soak and show up for team fight.
- if he gets a good trade against enemy offlaner, he still struggle to finish off due to structures,
- there is NO incentive to stay with minions, you get rewarded for double soaking only.

Early levels with NEW Changes:
- if tower/gate down you can continue pushing enemy hero (50 armour) while minions eat shots,
- you can also just attack structure, incentive to stay on lane with minions, 7 minions at level 1 do about 402 dps to structures. On average heroes at level 1 do around 100 AA DPS, so a 35% to minions is worth more than a 2nd hero next to you.
- you can mix up above, abilities don't trigger minion buff. Only AA and it is only 3s, so you better be decent mechanically.
- OR you can do what you were doing before patch and just double soak.

With these changes me may see a 1-1-3 composition more often?I feel like these changes are very beneficial for aggressive macro players. It gives you more advantages if you are ahead or pushed up

Might feel like shit to play against melee assassins or bruisers with good damage since they can actually push forts without tanking if you have nothing else to do, which most of the time is because you have good macro and already took everything on the map

Like for example dehaka can just walk up to a tower and use W without really punished. But I don't recommend doing this if you have other shit to do. But it's an interesting idea I can finally use my abilities on fort without fear of tanking tower shots. That's also a dps increase. This affects all fort pushes, like pushing with zerg wave or dragon knight.

Previous focus on 5v5 teamfighting may shift more towards macro pushing and defending against said push. You'll need a balance between fighting ability and wave clear in any team, as before, but the exact worth of these will shift slightly. Maybe lava wave will be more valuable for turning off minion pushing. Also the xp globe change will reward proper soaking, either fast rotations or having two solo-lanes. Earlier mercenary camps will reward early wave clear as well. This may cause games to snowball if you can't keep up in macro. 1-3-1 or so will probably be new meta.  Where 2 of the 3 then get camps together.

Bronze meta will stay ARAM for 5 minutes until one team has early gg.

I think I like it.  They’re kind of making a laning phase.  But I also like the bruiser style role. I'm curious about this as well. I don't play PTR but I wonder what will be general opinions after playing with it longer.
