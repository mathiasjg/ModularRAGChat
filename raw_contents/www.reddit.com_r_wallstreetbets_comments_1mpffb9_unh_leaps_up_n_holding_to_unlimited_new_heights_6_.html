[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) Holding 200 shares at average cost of 278.24 - DCA&#x27;ing every day (25 bucks a day) - and selling covered calls. LFG Congrats bro! Good pick, and this is the insane cherry on top Have some too, Hoping Buffet adds this tomorrow. will pay nicely :)) [deleted] Last thursday I was looking at UNH and bought 2 minutes before close. Clearly I timed the bottom &amp;amp; I&#x27;m liking how the UPNL looked. So... I maxed out this account. Timing the market is better than time in the market

Goodluck to all Well done sir! Exercise! You actually know what you&#x27;re doing compared to everyone who spent their last penny when it dipped to $380 after the CEO quit. So respect and congrats on the trade. Would love to hear your thoughts on the short-term direction, I bought some at a cost basis of about 245 and sold the 270 call which I am now regretting. Should I wait for it to drop a bit after I&#x27;m exercised out, or get back in right away? I think a lot of morons have been buying the stock which makes me think there&#x27;s still downside, plus the pattern has been Bad News -&amp;gt; Stock drops -&amp;gt; Moron buying pushes it partially back up -&amp;gt; More bad news, repeat. Thoughts? Yes! Letâ€™s get on this runn Waluigi I don&#x27;t get it.

134 calls with $66 average price. That&#x27;s 440k margin required to stay in the trade.

What are you hoping for the underlying will be worth? Let&#x27;s say 500 just for giggles. So the total value of the investment would be 1.3m. That translates into a ~31% annualized rate of return.

That&#x27;s seems like a lot of concentrated risk and capital lock-up for only OK returns, no? [deleted] Congrats on another $180k this evening. This is my tiny (because I&#x27;m poor) UNH position opened today. I might keep adding until it reaches $300 ahead of October&#x27;s earnings and sell before that. I don&#x27;t think the stock will go up more than $300 before earnings at least
