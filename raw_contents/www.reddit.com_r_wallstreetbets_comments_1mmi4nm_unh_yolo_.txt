[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) Get shares u greedy fuck Luigi Mangione making calls from jail Retards don't get this company is the #8 employer in the US and provides insurance to 100m+ Americans.

They can be as corrupt as they want, when the next admin rolls around everything that's being done right now will get undone.

Also seems like they're being compliant with the DOJ, and in this timeline being "compliant" means giving them a piece of the cake/scam.

300 by EOY. Maybe even by the first rate cut since everything will giga pump off cope. Nice one. I'm still getting shares bc I'm too much of a wuss to buy calls. What is with you guys and trying to catch the unh knife? People in the comments are regarded. Great play, although I had grabbed the $200s to be a bit safer (only a $20 premium diff with yours when I bought at $80). I‚Äôm gonna keep loading more if it keeps dipping back to my average, otherwise gonna let it play out. Institutions happily loading at these levels while retail remains emotional God speed Slightly smaller position with a slightly earlier timeline.

wish I had bought calls Warren gonna print for you LFG!!!! I prefer CNC. 

P/B ratio of 0.46 and P/S ratio of 0.07 for a company with billions in revenue and without the negative publicity and DOJ investigations. Just stated a position in UNH and CNC Thursday, I think both are due for a rebound What the sweet fuck In b4 equity goes to zero This is actually a great move, especially when the DOJ case gets settled This play is Golden.  Must win üèÜ Made the same play, around 3500 shares, and 50 $250 Dec 2025 calls in anticipation of a bounce back up towards 280 soon. I'll flip the options once they hit 50% profit and hang on to the shares as a longer term investment. Da fk kinda yolo is this? LEAPS... This isn't r/investing..  get outta here. RemindMe! 7 day A classic example of what market metrics are. You think a company is worth this or that, more or less, but in reality, you have no idea, because the shares themselves are worthless when weighed. This is evident in that companies that generate, for example, billions in revenue are worth less than companies that generate 100x less. And why? Because funds and banks are told that, in the future, they could be worth more.

But UNH is in the second group, those that generate billions and are worth little, because they are not tied to the AI or tech of the future. So, this strategy is much better to implement with Intel or Boeing or Asml, for example, because they are.
On the other hand, this one could also be worth less.
For example, GM is still the same as it was ten years ago. Not sure what currency OP‚Äôs pic is in, but I bought these same calls a week ago for 19.80 USD.  I was thinking after I bought that I should‚Äôve waited until a firmer bottom later in the month.

They‚Äôre up nearly 25% over the past week.  Now that I‚Äôm seeing this post on WSB, I‚Äôm selling at open on Monday. If they privatize the VA. I wonder if unh would get some of that There is more pain coming.  I wish you luck This gonna print hard.  Unless we see disruption of the health insurance industry lol.  Kodak never came back dawg.  It‚Äôs so possible this won‚Äôt either.  Idk what I‚Äôm even saying but I‚Äôm here for it. Like it Probably not optimal but a decent position. It's at the Monthly 200. Seems like a pretty incredible value play to me. Rolls Royce, Yacht or both? strong pass on UNH Any thoughts on duol anyone?! It‚Äôs a good sign for calls when most of the opinions on this thread still lean bearish. Seeing a higher low print last week over the week prior is progress that tides could be turning. Also closing above 250 is another good sign. Be greedy when others are fearful. Why are you guys obsessed with this dog shit stock Great call. These will print yoloing 125 calls? bold strategy, cotton. let‚Äôs see if it pays off. Is that you DFV? lol I have been buying some of these out to June and Dec 2027. 5x min by late 2026. I have so many shares. Too many shares, some may say. But my shares are the biggest and most beautiful shares one could lay eyes on. It's true, people are talking about it. And they only get better, once UNH hits 600 eoy. Thank you for your attention to this matter! On what day last week did you buy this? Will you be adding more tomorrow if it goes up? This is going to print. I bought March 2026 $250 calls last week and have fully convinced myself its going to 3x Does BBAI have an angle on AI security that the mag7 haven‚Äôt already covered with defense? Am I the only one seeing someone moved the decimal over on the market value to make it look really good? Amazing Congrats, man congratz, you're eating good tonight :D Update?
