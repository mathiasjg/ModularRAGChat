*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/passive_income) if you have any questions or concerns.* With $500 to start, one solid option is creating digital products. You can make templates, guides or ebooks using Canva and sell them on Gumroad or Etsy. Once uploaded, they can bring in sales passively if they solve a real problem.

Print on demand is another great route. Use a site like Printful to design t-shirts, mugs or stickers. Focus on trends like memes, motivational quotes or niche hobbies. Once your designs are uploaded, Printful handles the printing and shipping, so you donâ€™t deal with inventory or logistics. Promote your products on Instagram or Pinterest to get traffic.

You can also try affiliate marketing. Recommend tools or books and earn commissions when people buy through your links. Write useful content and share it in Reddit threads or niche forums. This compounds over time if your posts are helpful.

Dropshipping on eBay is still beginner friendly. eBay already gets a lot of traffic so you donâ€™t need ads. You list products from suppliers and only place an order when someone buys. Itâ€™s low risk and works even with just a couple hours a week.

If you want long-term growth, consider investing a portion in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. It wonâ€™t bring fast income but it quietly builds wealth.

I go deeper on all these methods in my newsletter if you want a step-by-step breakdown. Link is in my bio. Hey, totally get it â€“ starting with just $500 and no safety net is tough, but there are real ways to make money online. Here's what I'd look into:

- Freelancing (writing, design, translation â€“ platforms like Fiverr or Upwork)
- Online surveys &amp; user testing (e.g., Prolific, UserTesting â€“ small but steady)
- Matched betting (low risk if you understand it well â€“ not for everyone)
- Microtasks or referral-based platforms (apps, tools, affiliate-style systems)

Good luck â€“ and keep at it. You can build from here. ðŸ’ª Beermoney is a great side hustle for me! I make a reddit post with all my free time monthly earnings here:Â [2025 earnings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneySP/comments/1kbudbg/lista_de_trabajos_online_abril_2025/)Â It's just microtasking in different platforms and getting paid through PayPal, I got most of the platforms I use from thisÂ [website](https://linktr.ee/beermoneyspain). If you never tried something similar, I recommend to begin with Prolific, Serpclix, PaidViewpoint or PawnsApp. I started matched betting almost a year ago now whilst being a final year finance student at university. Since then Iâ€™ve learnt the industry inside and out and itâ€™s now my full time income which is pretty cool. Iâ€™m happy to show you how it works? :) Other than the methods already mentioned in the comments, you could look into downloading Atlas Earth on your phone. It's slow earning, especially when starting out but it's still passive income at the end of the day (only takes a few minutes per day depending on how much activity you wanna put into it).

There's a sub for it on reddit if you wanna verify the legitimacy of the app or see what other users may be talking about If you're starting from scratch, sites like Freecash can help you make a bit pretty quickly by doing app or survey offers â€” I made around $20 in my first few days. Not life-changing, but decent for emergencies while you explore longer-term options like freelancing or remote gigs. Taking surveys always works Make YouTube faceless channelsÂ  try surveys or affiliate market Hey, some of the common ways are digital asset creation and surveys. You can start by making an revolut account and refer people, they give 50 bucks (5 times) per month. So 250 in total each month. If you're interested, dm me.

 https://www.reddit.com/u/gitagon6991/s/6k7CbIgdvN Try using the Roam app by Metablox, you can earn rewards just by using the app. Great for getting started when funds are tight. Consider giving Instagram theme pages or faceless YouTube a shot! It takes a bit of effort, as nothing comes without work. Iâ€™m having fun with it myself and earning some on the side. If youâ€™re curious for more details, just drop me a message! Have you heard of TikTok clipping? Basically the brand gives you videos and you clip them and post on TikTok. I joined the Stocx Ai clipping team and they pay $2 per 1000 views. https://whop.com/stocx-ai/ I would recommend the subreddit beermoney. Additionally, I made a sub reddit that breaks down some sites and how to optimize them on my subreddit easymonies. Hope you find something useful. [removed] try dropshipping, I am in the same situation and I am about to launch my fisrt online shop Every post on corporatex.com is essentially passive income if u make quality content. Right now, during the early release, u can sign up as a "founding member," so u dont ever have to pay any subscription fees. 

Iâ€™d advise you not to overthink it at first, just pick something you can start without putting in huge investment. Skills like: writing, basic design, tutoring, or even selling stuff online can work. There was a time I  tried reselling phone accessories I found cheap on Alibaba, though it wasnâ€™t a goldmine, it gave me extra gas money. Some people do printâ€‘onâ€‘demand, others go into simple freelancing like writing blog posts or moderating forums. Whatever you choose, give it a couple months before judging if it works or not. Jumping around too quickly can frustrate progress. 
Honestly the easiest legit freebie Iâ€™ve found is Fetch Rewards.

You just snap any grocery/gas/drugstore receipt (or link your Amazon/Walmart orders) and it gives you points you can cash out for gift cards.  Use code A1XQRH when you sign up to get $2 free. If you're skilled in let's say design or writing - you can check out Freelancer, Fiverr etc.

If you're skilled in bringing in traffic/clients to various products, online offers and so on - try affiliate marketing.

Of course, you can always test your "luck" with trading as well, but I wouldn't recommend unless you're ready to lose your money. If you're in the US I have a system that can help you can make $450 today and over $2000 by the end of the month.

I have a free guide that shows how if you're interested. I just copy gold and btc trades from Silverbulls FX lol. Itâ€™s free once you sign up with their broker and sometimes Iâ€™m done in like 15 mins a day. No need to overthink.. I just follow the signals and move on with my day.
