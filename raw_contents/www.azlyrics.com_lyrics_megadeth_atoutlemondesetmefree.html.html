    <pre>Don&#x27;t remember where I was

I realized life was a game

The more seriously I took things

The harder the rules became

I had no idea what it&#x27;d cost

My life passed before my eyes

When I found out how little I accomplished

All my plans denied



So as you read this know my friends

I&#x27;d love to stay with you all

Please smile when you think of me

My body&#x27;s gone that&#x27;s all



Ã tout le monde 
[To all the world]

Ã tout mes amis 
[To all my friends]

Je vous aime 
[I love you]

Ã tout mes amis 
[To all my friends]

Je vous aime 
[I love you]

Je dois partir 
[I have to leave]

These are the last words

I&#x27;ll ever speak

And they&#x27;ll set me free



If my heart was still alive

I know it would surely break

And my memories left with you

There&#x27;s nothing more to say



Moving on is a simple thing

What it leaves behind is hard

You know the sleeping feel no more pain

And the living are scarred



Ã tout le monde 
[To all the world]

And the living are scarred



Ã tout le monde 
[To all the world]

Ã tout mes amis 
[To all my friends]

Je vous aime 
[I love you]

Je dois partir 
[I have to leave]

These are the last words

I&#x27;ll ever speak

And they&#x27;ll set me free



So as you read this know my friends

I&#x27;d love to stay with you all

Please smile, smile when you think about me

My body&#x27;s gone that&#x27;s all



Ã tout le monde 
[To all the world]

Ã tout mes amis 
[To all my friends]

Je vous aime 
[I love you]

Ã tout mes amis 
[To all my friends]

Je vous aime 
[I love you]

Je dois partir 
[I have to leave]

These are the last words

I&#x27;ll ever speak

And they&#x27;ll set me free


[2x]



These are the last words

I&#x27;ll ever speak

And they&#x27;ll set me free</pre>
