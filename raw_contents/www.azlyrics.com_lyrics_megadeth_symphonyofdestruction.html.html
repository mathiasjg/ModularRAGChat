    <pre>You take a mortal man

And put him in control

Watch him become a god

Watch people&#x27;s heads a-roll

A-roll, A-roll



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction



Acting like a robot

Its metal brain corrodes

You try to take its pulse

Before the head explodes

Explodes, Explodes



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony

Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction



The earth starts to rumble

World powers fall

A-warring for the heavens

A peaceful man stands tall

A-tall, A-tall



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

Swaying to the Symphony



Just like the Pied Piper

Led rats through the streets

We dance like marionettes

Swaying to the Symphony



Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction</pre>
