[deleted]Nobody can tell you anything from a single random slice of an MRI. When we look at MRIs clinically, we look at all kinds of different imaging sequences and scan through the entire brain. I'm like 99% sure this is a human head. It's as interesting as any other head MRI. In the UK at least, if they see anything in your scans that looks disease related they pass your information on to a clinician who takes a look and contacts you if the concerns are warranted. If you weren't contacted you are fine.

Your scan looks fine to me but I don't work on humans. Cool images. What kind of tasks were you doing? Memory tasks? OP, suggest you upload everything you have into ChatGPT and report back your results. I have multiple brain scan MRI's. Sadly the resolution of each slice are rather shitty. nice to see the donders on here haha. very normal looking section. completely unremarkabke omg i got more scansðŸ˜­ i got the dicom file, for someone who doesnt know anything about radiology it looks so weirdâ€¦.
