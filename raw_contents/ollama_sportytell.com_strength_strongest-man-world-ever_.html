It&#x27;s not an easy task to rank this strongman among others as his past is a blur. But reports and accounts have him lifting bars that most people can&#x27;t even grab or place their fingers across. He was also likely the first strong athlete, not just a strongman, because he was very fit and agile, not just powerful and bulky.

Terry Hollands, known as Britain’s Strongest Man and England’s Strongest Man, was born on June 6, 1979.

He was undoubtedly a strongman who didn&#x27;t hesitate to showcase his strength at the slightest opportunity. Mariusz Pudzianowski, known as &quot;Dominator,&quot; is of Polish descent and is the only man alive to have won the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition five times.

His first attempt at the WSM title wasn’t so bad; he finished fourth. He didn&#x27;t return to the game the following year due to a 19-month prison sentence. In 2002, Pudzianowski won his first World&#x27;s Strongest Man title. He defended it in 2003 with an engaging style, winning the title after leading in one event and recording the highest total points ever in the competition’s history. More intriguingly, he finished in the top three in every event that year. He defended his title convincingly.

In 2004, Pudzianowski was surprisingly beaten to third place in the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition. Currently, The Dominator is a mixed martial artist. However, in 2005 he regained his title and successfully defended it for the following two years.

In March 2020, at the Arnold Sports Classic, he set another world record by bench pressing 770 pounds.

Eddie Hall “The Beast” The English five-time Strongest Man champion, Eddie Hall, gained prominence when he won the 2017 World’s Strongest Man competition. One of his most notable achievements is his world record in the deadlift, which he set in 2016 by lifting 500 kg. Despite several attempts by other athletes to surpass or achieve this record, it remained unbroken until Hafþór Björnsson broke it in 2020. Additionally, Hall also won the UK Strongest Man title six times. His place among the strongest men in modern history is well-deserved.

Com Andy Bolton is majorly known for being the first man to deadlift over a thousand pounds in a powerlifting competition. The English powerlifter made his debut in a powerlifting competition at the age of 21 and participated in the 2002 Arnold Strongman Classic, finishing fifth place. His squats are also impressive; he holds the current World Power Lifting Organization record with an incredible 1,213 lb lift.

Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson “Thor” Bjornsson is widely known for his role as Ser Gregor “The Mountain” in the popular series Game of Thrones. However, when he is not acting, he competes as a strongman. In 2015, at the World’s Strongest Viking competition in Norway, Björnsson broke a 1,000-year-old record by carrying a 10-meter-long log weighing 1,430 lb for five steps. He participated in the 2018 World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition and became the champion, becoming the first Icelander to clinch the title since 1996. Additionally, he has emerged as the winner of Europe’s Strongest Man five times and won his third Arnold Strongman Classic championship earlier this year, becoming the first to win the ASC three consecutive times.

He is also the first person to have won Europe’s Strongest Man, Arnold Strongman Classic, and Europe’s Strongest Man in a single calendar year. Bill Kazmaier, known as &quot;Kaz,&quot; is an American former powerlifting world champion. He was a notable and feared figure in strength competitions during the 1970s–1980s. Kaz set several strongman records, including being the first person to lift five McGlashen stones that each weigh between 250-300 pounds. He won the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition three times and excelled in feats of strength alongside other famous strongmen of his era. Bill Kazmaier was known for claiming to be &quot;the strongest man who ever lived.&quot; He is undoubtedly one of the strongest men on earth.

Brian Shaw, nicknamed &quot;Gigantor,&quot; undoubtedly holds a place among the world&#x27;s strongest men. He is a four-time champion of the World&#x27;s Strongest Man and has also won the Arnold Strongman Classic three times. Brian Shaw achieved impressive lifts, including a 903-pound squat and a 1,025-pound deadlift. Additionally, he won the Giants Live twice and the Strongman Super Series three times.

Zydrunas Savickas, often referred to as &quot;Big Z,&quot; is indeed considered the strongest man on the planet ever. He has won numerous tournaments that are too many to remember or count. In 1998, he secured his first win in the Lithuania Strongest Man contest. In 2001, Savickas suffered a severe injury during competition and was away from strength exhibiting games for approximately nine months. Many sports pundits believed his career was over due to the significant impact of these injuries. However, he made an impressive return in 2002, winning the Lithuania Strongest Man contest once again, marking the start of his victory ramp.

Savickas continued his dominance by winning the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2014. He also won six consecutive Arnold Strongman Classics and three times emerged victorious as Europe’s Strongest Man. The list of his achievements goes on, making it almost impossible to summarize them all here. Truly, one could write a book about the countless feats and accomplishments of Zydrunas Savickas.

I&#x27;m pretty sure they couldn&#x27;t even hit me, an average male 16-year-old because of how slow they are.

Oberyn Martell said the same thing!

And I am pretty sure you’re not able to do anything they are capable of.

Shout out to all the strongmen.

I lifted the horse. I am the strongest.

Dominated by Whites – Not because of the anti-White conspiracy of so-called “White privilege,” as the intellectually challenged like to excuse everything with, but because of a known scientific fact that Whites are pound-for-pound the strongest race.

Reply Donald Robertson November 11, 2020
You’re wrong about &quot;pound-for-pound.&quot; Look up the records; lower weight divisions are dominated by Asians and Pacific Islanders. If white guys were stronger pound-for-pound, they would dominate all weight divisions.

Reply Forrester January 14, 2021
Yes, I also think Pacific Islanders/Asians are as or even possibly stronger.

Reply Forrester January 14, 2021
That is absolutely true.

Reply Billionaire Ope November 24, 2020
Why isn’t Martin Livis on this list?

Reply Bob December 5, 2020
This article doesn’t make sense. Marius is the only one who won the World’s Strongest Man competition five times and he’s 8th.

Reply Stevie December 13, 2020
Geoff Capes did very well, though things were different in his day.

Reply Ed Smith December 14, 2020
I had a great uncle who pulled an oak tree out of the ground and threw it across a cow pasture, landing on top of my neighbor’s house.

Reply Eric December 22, 2020
How is Mark Henry not on here?

Reply David December 23, 2020
Exactly.

Reply Forrester January 14, 2021
He’s too weak, boy. 

Reply Excel January 17, 2021
Are you stronger than him???.

Reply to Joe June 4, 2022

It isn&#x27;t easy to be a strongman. Have you ever lifted 60 kilograms overhead with one hand or deadlifted 300 kilograms? Go to a gym and try! See if you can even come close to the aforementioned feats.
