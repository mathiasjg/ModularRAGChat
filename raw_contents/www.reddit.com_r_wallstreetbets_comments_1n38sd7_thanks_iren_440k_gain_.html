Paper gains = nothing I always feel like these posts gotta either be fake or insider trading…. Am I crazy? Wish I got in on this at $14 and then again at $17. Congrats Total beast I have some as well I get it, some how I admire your dedication and here is why.

You risk 140k by buying a call option for 3 weeks and today that stock went up 9 points just before expiring.

Fantastic!!!

Somehow the other day a guy posted he was done because he lost 3.5M and today he is holding 365.00 well you are a pure example. 

Money is nothing, today you have it, tomorrow you don’t simply as that no hard feelings.

Congratulations from this gains!!! What was the stock? Nice 👍 keep it up Okay gains for call options. Takes serious balls to buy them for 600k tho. Either the OP has more than 10 mil portfolio or is just highly regarded. pls help me make a profit like this !!! single mother from cape town and need this so badly K Jesus.. did you already sell your september ones? Today was crazy It’s crazy that someone bought the contracts🤣 Beautiful plays I’m up 740%~, but I only bought 1 contract 😔</pre></body></html>
