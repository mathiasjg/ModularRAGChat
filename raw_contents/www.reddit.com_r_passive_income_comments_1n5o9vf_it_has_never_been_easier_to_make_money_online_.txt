How to actually make 5-6 figures a month using AI

I use AI models to monetise on OnlyFans/Fansly/Fanvue/Telegram (with their new Pay with Stars feature). From experience, I personally would say the resources to create content - whether it’s for Instagram or NSFW content to sell has only been good enough by the start of 2025

Most people you see online who say, “AI made me financially free,” are doing this. I’m revealing it because I simply believe it’s fair for everyone to know how these businesses work. So YES, it’s an unsaturated market, and there’s no reason it won’t take over - so my message is: start now.

Note: people who tell you "I run an AI marketing agency" or something along these lines, in other words do what I'm about to share with you

You may be thinking, why am I sharing this? Because I’m already solidified in the space. I make (and am able to make) far more money, and I want everyone to know how certain people make money. I had no prior experience with AI, but I now make around £2k–10k a week per model - a little more in dollars. And the best thing about it is every single penny goes to me. With the average OF manager only taking anywhere from 40–50% of their total income due to profit splits with human models, using AI models that I generate, I keep everything, and I don’t have to rely on a human model to make content for me. And everyone underestimates the work that these agency owners put in.

The biggest issue in this space is lazy models. I find that this solves it. Before anyone questions it, I am able to show proof of earnings to those who have a genuine interest - if you’re curious or don’t believe me - but I won’t show my models in case any haters try to ban them lol. All you need is a computer and it is a business that once set up, you can work from anywhere in the world.

What I am looking at now is creating my very own website. I genuinely think it will be great, because right now the biggest competitor is a website called “CandyAI,” but honestly, their AI content is terrible. I can create full 5-minute tapes that actually look real. I plan on creating the website with pay-based options like chatting to the model (handled by a team), possibly subscription-based, and video bundles as one-off payments.

If anyone has any questions, I understand it’s a very polarizing topic, so no hate please. If you have questions or suggestions for the website I’m creating, let me know. I’ll aim to answer everyone’s question.

I remember seeing a post about four things that will always be in demand - and adult service was one of them. I believe it’s the future of the space, and every current or soon-to-be OF manager should definitely gain some insight into it. You may be wondering why I was able to go so quickly from just learning to £2k–10k a week. It’s because I was an OF manager before - I made a lot of money, but eventually the models became lazy, I was missing days of promotion content, their socials started to crash, and so did profits. Without social media, my model was nothing. She failed to make content some days, which greatly hurt her IG/TikTok pages, so I sacked her off and came up with a solution. I decided to make the switch to AI, it was complicated, I did spend alot of time leaning about it but eventually I came up with my own system for creating images and videos - and using my prior marketing knowledge, I was able to skyrocket from there.

Anyway, I don’t want to make this too long - any questions, I’ll do my best to replyCheck out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.

And of “manager” is just glorified online pimp. So i will start: are you ashamed of yourself? Which AI do you use to create the models Share some proof of work please. These posts are all I see on this sub lately What are u using to create content? CandyAI is NOT your competition. Your competition is coming from all the daily "I made $XXXX using AI on OF &amp; Fanvue" posts we see in these subs every day. Most people will fail, of course, but it still creates a glut of morons stumbling into the market blinding looking for fans, but just creating more competition for each other.

The standalone website, however, has some potential, but with live chatters you're really just creating yet another livecam site, but without the actual cams...the marketing will be the same though.

I started in the adult space almost 20 years ago, and niche fetish content still sells, so I think if you do a good drill down you could do well with it. Good luck! How much does it cost to create the models/content though? All of the major platforms bans AI models, so where are you able to monetize these AI models then? I wish I knew what you are talking about how do you promote? this is such an eye-opener! It’s incredible how you’ve leveraged AI to create a sustainable income stream. I’ve recently started using tools like GPT Scrambler alongside other AI platforms, and it has really transformed my approach to content creation. The ability to generate unique and engaging content quickly has saved me so much time and effort.

As a student, it’s been a game-changer for my projects, allowing me to focus on quality while still meeting deadlines. I can only imagine how powerful it is for your models! Plus, with the right strategy, anyone can tap into this emerging market. Your insights on the unsaturated nature of this space are inspiring. Thanks for sharing your journey and encouraging others to explore these opportunities! Looking forward to seeing how your website develops! Building your own site is a good move.
