    <pre>Being round you is driving me crazy

Watching you run is making me lazy

You&#x27;re trying to buy a place in my head

Telling me lines I&#x27;ve already read

Speaking my name to try to confuse me

Say it again you&#x27;re starting to lose me



That&#x27;s alright I&#x27;m okay

It happens every single day

It&#x27;s all the same

But I&#x27;m not blind



It&#x27;s all about you not me

It&#x27;s all about the things

That you&#x27;re expecting me to be

There&#x27;s not enough time to live

And all that you&#x27;re expecting me to give

There&#x27;s not enough time to live

And all that you&#x27;re expecting me to give



It&#x27;s all about you not me

It&#x27;s all about you not me



You&#x27;re building my prison brick by brick

Eating your words is making me sick

You get what you want

Cause nothing is sacred

You&#x27;re reading my mind

And leaving me naked

You say I gotta give before I receive it

One of these days I&#x27;ll believe it



It&#x27;s all about you not me

It&#x27;s all about the things

That you&#x27;re expecting me to be

It&#x27;s all about you not me

It&#x27;s all about the things

That you&#x27;re expecting me to be

There&#x27;s not enough time to live

And all that you&#x27;re expecting me to give



It&#x27;s all about you not me

It&#x27;s all about you not me</pre>
