Class Item: D2 Master Crota&#x27;s End Boost FAQ

What is Master Crota’s End?
It’s the hard-mode version of the Moon raid with higher Power, added Champions, tighter timers, and weekly challenge requirements. It’s the only way to earn Adept (Master) versions of Crota’s End weapons, plus the Cursed Thrall origin trait and extra endgame materials.

How to complete Crota’s End on Master difficulty?
Success hinges on clean role assignments and survivability. Bring anti-Champion and resist mods with burst DPS. Execute mechanics precisely: lantern routes in Abyss; plate/brand swaps on Bridge; tome and Deathsinger control for Ir Yût; then coordinated sword timing and Oversoul management on Crota. Complete the rotating weekly Master challenge for each Adept drop.

How many secret chests are in Crota’s End? There are two secret chests. Both can award raid gear you’ve already unlocked (weapons/armor from your loot pool) and raid mods, offering extra rolls while you chase specific drops.

Who is the final boss of Crota’s End? The final boss is Crota, Son of Oryx. The fight centers on the Chalice of Light/Enlightened buff, killing Swordbearers to wield Hive swords, breaking Crota’s shield, and timing Oversoul management during damage phases.
