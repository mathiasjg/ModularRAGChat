Coming this spring to a portfolio near you:

Congratulations on your victory This goes hard as fuck ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641) In the background, you can see the famous rooftop bar, O'Tittie's. "His name is Powell. Jerome Powell, asshole." Dumb question, but those nft’s that trump grifted last week, did he use AI generator or did he like commission Eric and his crayons. He ain’t burning down Wall Street, he’s burning down Main Street! My god he's beautiful Here he is vacuuming money

"The Fast and Furious....way to raise interest rates"
Staring Jerome Powell as Jerome Powell

Critics are raving!
" He's making a mistake!" - jeremy siegel
" He is throwing us into a recession" - CNBC Calls on Nvidia… ...that is alarmingly badass for anything posted in or about this gourd forsaken casino. Who is this old guy and how does he do all this damage? Chad Powell Fucking cool as shit


Unlike my portfolio Uh, I'm starting to have second thoughts about fighting the Fed. Be a real G and put  " Jerome Powell eating ass " in there ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275) Don't lie this was from Jerome's LinkedIn profile. More of a glamour shot than anything else clearly. Nice. Maybe try Elon burning tsla down? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641) Link to the AI generator? Loab Go Jerome. JPow fucks! Ok, totally ignorant question here:  where do y’all keep finding these AI art generators?  I keep seeing posts like this, and I don’t understand how so many people have access to AI art generators Jerome Hayden "Jay" Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, defender of the Dollar, slayer of the Call Options That doesn’t look like JPow though What AI generator are you using
