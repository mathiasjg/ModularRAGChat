We are going back to when dive heavy heroes will just jump in, without a care in the world, and pick off anyone with low HP.  An extra 50 armor and slow dont matter when there is no reason not to overextend.

Not to mention that now if your losing a team fight, you can no longer retreat to the safety of a Fort.  The enemy will just chace you down and finish you off.  It kind of makes structures pointless.  Minions getting inspired also is meaningless.

The structures prioritizing heroes is what punishes overextending and hyper aggressive play.  How is no longer needing to play smart a good thing for the game?

Most of the PTR patch stuff looks pretty good, but this one change is going to make the game cancerous. I think giving some armor around fort like 10 or 15 would not be a bad change,  
But going back to old fort targeting system is not a good idea at all.  
Game became far better when forts started to target heroes. As a Zeratul main, I totally unbiasedly hope noone listens to OP I don&#x27;t think you were that safe under tower from zeratul in the current system honestly. I think you underestimate how tanky 50% armor is. I think youll see a lot of people whiff when they try to dive someone this actually hurts illidans from diving in behind towers. as a illidan main this hurts my soul. This change may also nerf Genji in a way, as he wants his deflect to proc as many times as possible when diving a low-health hero. However, due to the added armor and new targeting, Genji might be changed completely in terms of diving. I think giving the attacker a 20% slow would be to hard and won&#x27;t affect all heroes the same. I think giving the defender hero 20% move peed would be better for the 4 seconds This will be a change that will drastically drop the pickrate of Abathur. Or at least the win rate People felt the same when jt was changed the opposite way Dive heavy heroes are already ignoring tower shots with invincibilities/invuln/teleports/evades. What you actually want is more armor so it’s harder to land a kill when diving. It also increases the importance of waveclear while defending. Let it play out, it might be different than you think. This is going to be terrible... I think Anub will be crazy this patch.  If enemy team has multiple people under a fort he can dive under the fort with no minions, create beetles to eat the tower shots, and cocoon the armor buffed hero. how does it actually play on ptr? I suspect the defense buff it gives is strong and might put more work in than people are giving it credit for Let&#x27;s see how it works out before coming to any conclusions. It only matters if theres a minion wave. Just play smart and clear the wave. You get an infinite 50 armor (if its just you there) and they are infinitely slowed. I think a lot of people are going to try diving good players and end up disappointed.  I’m going to make a poll on this. I dunno, I think the faceroll wave clear heroes are a little too strong right now and need to be more killable. I&#x27;m thinking heroes like Nazeebo, who is S+ tier, who can just double soak lanes and hide behind fort and never engage in PvP gameplay. 

This is also a good change for certain heroes who can&#x27;t attack forts without dealing splash damage to the enemy. I&#x27;m thinking Cassia with her 3rd AA splash talent. It&#x27;s a pain in the ass attacking forts because she pulls threat every 3rd attack. Yeah this change stuck out to me the most. Years ago forts and keeps were changed TO prioritize heroes. And I don&#x27;t remember the last time I seen somebody say that aspect of Hots was imbalanced and complained about it. Guess they never heard of &quot;If it aint broke don&#x27;t fix it&quot;. Prioritize stuff that&#x27;s actually broken/suspected of being broken. Hear hear! No. Current tower aggro can&#x27;t react well to unintended hero hits and simultaneous attack from 2+ heroes. Too low-quality mechanic, forts deserve something better.

&amp;gt;An extra 50 armor and slow dont matter when there is no reason not to overextend.

Clear the lane, and you&#x27;ll be protected MUCH better than before. You actually get punished if you draft like crap now and can&#x27;t handle any pressure under fort. On the other hand, afk azmos and nazeebos are buffed so that&#x27;s  an L. But anyway you can still outplay the dive, you actually now how to play correctly instead of just running in circles. You will get punished for bad positioning and it rewards well coordinated dives. I don&#x27;t think anyone can still 1v1 the defender under the fort anyway. 

Now you can&#x27;t pick slow ass mages with stitches and   morales and expect to get away with shit positioning by just running away behind a fort. Bad gameplay and bad drafts will get punished more so that&#x27;s a win. 

Low ranks will probably be infested with afk pushers and higher ranks I have no idea, maybe high tempo bruiser dive comps or objective winning deathballs. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to be net positive or not in that area, but there are theoretical positives so we will have to see. I really want to try it and see. An extra 50 armor definitely does matter. Good luck diving and killing a hero defending their fort with 50 armor. The PTR looks really good minus the fort change stuff. I agree. I’m a Sylvanas main and I rely on auto-targeting to pick my angles.

We’ll see how it balances with the minion updates This game has been on its last legs for literal years. Why the hell are they still changing core mechanics?! I think it&#x27;s better for enabling an off-laner to hold their lane solo against a push and desuading 1v1 tower dives. 

Say you have an Abathur sitting up at fort. Anyone that is just ok with heroes like Zeratul, Medivh, or Nova, can combo out the Abathur and not even take a tower shot in response. also no tower further out to target the backdoor nova snipe. This is going to be a significant nerf to heroes that finish off kills by diving solo targets typically during ganks, 1v1s, etc. Very often your tank will gank an enemy on a sidelane and during the 2v1 the enemy will get past their gate but low enough that you can finish them with one more spell or auto. This indirectly nerfs both tanks and divers and makes hard cc even more important. Dive-heavy heroes will absolutely not flourish from this change (except sustain dive like Illidan). Genji and Zeratul will have a *much* harder time doing their job now. Especially against any hero with any self-sustain. As a Gul&#x27;dan main, if this change goes through, I may never fear another Genji fort dive again. Sure, he won&#x27;t get targeted immediately, but I&#x27;ll definitely heal faster than he can do DPS. Meanwhile every extra second he sticks around trying to make up for his damage being cut in half is an extra second my team is rotating and an extra second I can clear the wave, forcing him to retreat. 

Do I think the game is better with forts prioritizing heroes? Yeah. Do I think this change will make the game worse? I&#x27;m not sure yet. But do I think it&#x27;ll make dive better? Absolutely not. Dive is gonna struggle after this while self-sustain heroes get a massive buff. Not sure if you&#x27;re just trolling or not, but that is huge buff to people being dived. Most tanks, bruisers and melee assassins can easily stand the current -20 armor to the point that they could eat around 2 shots more before they would die after securing the kill. With 50 armor you can 1v2 and in some cases even 1v3 under your fort. It&#x27;s horrible change that rewards passive low skill play while punishing more skillful and riskier play. Buildings aren&#x27;t there to protect you, it&#x27;s your job to protect them. Li ming level 20 Archon mode against towers and core: I will be more careful, or maybe not 🤑 &amp;gt; We are going back to when dive heavy heroes will just jump in, without a care in the world, and pick off anyone with low HP

That&#x27;s... already the case? Have you ever fought coordinated premade teams? They can jump in below a fort and rotate aggro and they can stay 20 seconds non-stop below a fort destroying your team and then pushing while still tanking cannonballs cause it tickles tanks and everyone&#x27;s still gonna be full hp if the healer&#x27;s not shit.

&amp;gt; Not to mention that now if your losing a team fight, you can no longer retreat to the safety of a Fort

Of course you can? There&#x27;s not always going to be mercs or a wave below a fort.

&amp;gt; Minions getting inspired also is meaningless.

What? Why? Yeah but how does it play in PTR?  it&#x27;s easy to theorycraft but it&#x27;s usually not how practice plays out Yeah it sounds dumb and at the same time I hate how forts wreck me. There&#x27;s so many just wrong assumptions in here... 

  
&quot;We are going back to when dive heavy heroes will just jump in, without a care in the world, and pick off anyone with low HP. An extra 50 armor and slow dont matter when there is no reason not to overextend.&quot; - that&#x27;s LITERALLY double your health pool as a defender. If you have any self healing, you&#x27;re now close to immortal unless the enemy is hitting you with 4+ people diving your fort (and they have no minions or summons to draw shots). 

&quot;you can no longer retreat to the safety of a Fort. The enemy will just chace you down and finish you off. It kind of makes structures pointless. Minions getting inspired also is meaningless.&quot; - Minions getting inspired gives a boost to defenders who can kill enemy minions quickly, thus ensuring that any enemy divers take fort shots. Your assumption is only true if they also have minions on your fort, which is not always the case. If you lost a teamfight \*AND your enemy minions are on your fort..... then you deserve to die. 

&quot;The structures prioritizing heroes is what punishes overextending and hyper aggressive play. How is no longer needing to play smart a good thing for the game?&quot;-- Forts will still hit divers unless they have minions on your fort already. I can&#x27;t think of any divers that also have summons. 

Also, the Genji dive deflect garbage is slightly worse - because if the fort doesn&#x27;t shoot him, he can&#x27;t deflect it.   
Zeratul (wormhole) probably benefits the most from this change. 

  
I&#x27;m personally excited to try things out :) I disagree. We will ultimately have to wait and see, but that 50% damage reduction is a huge buff which makes trading damage under the tower favor the defender by a wide margin.

This change gives a buff to heroes with waveclear in both attacking and defending a tower (clear the wave attacking your tower and the tower will attack the enemy hero, while an attacking player can focus on doing more damage to the fort without worrying about his abilities attracting tower shots), and a person defending against a push even without waveclear can easily dish out damage to the enemy without worrying too much about being punished for defending your tower since they only take half damage.  
Plus if you are being dived by multiple people the towers buff defends you from all attackers, while before the tower only attacked one hero at a time, and it puts a near stop to the cheeky burst damage heroes that can dive in and kill someone while ignoring the tower shots anyways, like Zeratul, Illidan, or Nova. And if you don&#x27;t have enemy creep attacking your tower, you now have both the buff and the tower shots defending you. So this is ultimately a buff for anyone defending a tower (including abathur, who should not be under a tower that is being attack by creep anyways even now, but now can live 100% longer to tunnel away). The only thing that concerns me are the heroes that can spawn minions to tank the tower shots if they dive. This only shifts the danger away from heroes like I mention above to minion heroes, except minion heroes have less burst and still have to deal with the 50% armor. Forts and Keeps no longer attack anything BUT heroes on the PTR, assuming an enemy hero attacks another hero near the building. Same for Cores.

As for Towers, they don&#x27;t do anything on the PTR. They wobble a bit sometimes, but never attack heroes or minions. I actually heavily agree with this.  You’re vastly safer from hyperaggressive dives, but more imperiled if you aren’t doing anything to control the wave.  If you’re taking care of the minions and not just letting the towers and forts do all the work for you, then that fort will still blow a diver up if they try to come at you without minions.

The community is agonizingly timid in the game as it is now.  Most folks are dogmatically insistent to only push passively through mercenary camps, objectives and crashing the wave.  Frightfully few people are willing to personally engage with an enemy structure, to the point where over half the community thinks the appropriate course of action after scoring a megakill is to go take a mercenary camp on their own side of the map instead of taking the enemy nexus.

As a result of outsourcing so much pressure onto monsters, minions and mercenaries, the meta has formed into a “CC is king” and “burst is the only damage that matters” attitude where the way you get kills and succeed in fights is to keep someone unable to control their character from 100 to 0 through permanent stun combos paired with frontloaded damage that gasses out immediately afterwards.  With these changes, characters with less CC/utility/burst but more consistent damage will become more valuable and have a stronger presence in the game.  CC, meanwhile, will be more in line with being a means of support rather than BEING the means itself.  That’s healthy balance.

As things are now, we’re in this weird mix where on one side of the coin, people are too afraid of the enemy’s half of the map to dare set foot over there, and goodness forbid they actually take a structure themselves without some super long range ability.  Yet somehow on the other side of the coin, these same, risk averse people want to spend most of the game as a team death match and ignore the actual moba elements like lane control and macro play, instead favoring nonstop five stack brawls or roaming death balls.  Whole thing feels like the worst elements of ARAM and standard moba put together.

With these changes, getting ganked by four people 24/7 isn’t as likely to happen, either.  Those experience globes won’t be waiting for the death ball when they make their way to another lane, lessening the snowball effect of doing so.  Individual laners must now sacrifice experience to make a gank, so it becomes a strategic choice instead of the obviously best option all the time.  But also, now that you’re encouraged to hit enemy structures, ganks have a more balanced chance of succeeding since you’ll be further extended more often, so it doesn’t kill ganking either.  It’s a fine balance. Isn&#x27;t this combined witharmor for people attacked in core area + speed debuff for the attacking parties? so is everyone just gunna stay grouped as 5 from now on, start matches at the top and move down clearing forts as you go. So long as enemy engages 5 vs 4 you win every engagement. seems boring to me, almost turns it into an ARAM match where there is no longer a need for map/battle awareness. I welcome these changes considering all the players complaining are bronze or silver (at best). Bring back ammo! Disagree. I think it will encourage more fighting (and therefore fun) around structures. Right now, it outright cock blocks it. If this was a poll, I’m for the changes. Diving as a 4-5 man team shouldn’t be so risky to just kill 1 person. The fort/keep lowers armour AND can do 1-2k damage in under 10 seconds.

Oh even better when you’re trying to dive an 4-5 man enemy team with a BOSS like Punisher or Angel/Demon. It makes it completely boring whereas you can only focus tower keep while you get poked Wait are they really changing this? Lol. You’re right OP - that’s a terrible idea. have you even tried it before complaining about it? That also assumes minions are pushing the forts and keeps, which they usually would not be.  You shouldn’t be out fighting past structures while enemy minions are pushing your structures. It’s a bizarre change, definitely. Maybe removing the armor reduction would’ve been a better idea. Idk if the game should incentivise diving forts/keeps though, I’m not sure it’s healthy for the game I think it will be an interesting change, it&#x27;s not like the non-heroic tower prioritization wasn&#x27;t a thing before. The armor buff will be very interesting to see. &amp;gt;How is no longer needing to play smart a good thing for the game?

Have you seen the state of the playerbase in the last 5 years? 90% are ARAM bots that can&#x27;t even look at their minimap to help at camps..</pre></body></html>
