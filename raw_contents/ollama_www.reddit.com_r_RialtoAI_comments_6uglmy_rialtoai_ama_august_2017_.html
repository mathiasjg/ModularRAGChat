Thank you everyone who participated in August&#x27;s AMA Session.
Here are the answers to ten most upvoted questions:


**Q1: During arbitrage operation, will profits be compounded as additional leverage for Rialto trading or are they pooled away for future distribution only?** 
*Yes, any increase in the asset pool is reinvested until the point of distribution. 
It is important to notice that the need for reinvestment is based on the market situation and it will be used only once a full utilization of existing asset pool is reached. We expect not to exceed the 50% utilization of the Digital Asset Pool in the next three months. Further utilization will be mostly dependant on the exchanges and gateways that will pass our background check. We will not connect market making platform to exchanges or gateways where the integrity of the assets could be easily compromised. At the time of writing, two cryptocurrency exchanges and one Ripple gateway have passed the background check and are to be connected to the trading algorithms.*

**Q2: One question a lot of people are dying to know: Which exchanges are you in talks with?** 
*We assume this question is related to the listing of the XRL token and not to exchanges used for trading. XRL token is currently listed on Livecoin and EtherDelta. Bittrex did not accept the listing proposal for XRL. We are in early talks with Binance but with no tangible agreement yet.*

**Q3: I spoke with a hedge fund manager about Rialto&#x27;s future prospects and this was his response: &quot;As a story I could see Rialto getting legs, but don&#x27;t like it as a business model. About to be commoditized. I&#x27;ve had daily calls with their competitors. A big hedge fund will do the same, but keep all the profits.&quot; Question from Rialto Token Holders: How will Rialto outcompete?** 
*We are aware that we are the first movers and currently one of the largest market makers on the market. New competitors will be entering the market on the ongoing basis, especially as the industry develops further. At the moment software architecture and robustness of the crypto exchanges and gateways are at a very low level and do not yet enable professional and automated market making or arbitrage solutions as are existent in financial systems. For example, the responsiveness of the systems is at such level, where the language in which algorithms are written, does not play any role in terms of competitive advantage. We are closely following the development of exchanges to be in step with the latest technical solutions. We are confident that we will be able to compete on the long term with the knowledge and the team that we have. 
The current competitive advantage is the teamâ€™s experience in AI, the knowledge on which exchanges and gateways have certain shortcomings and how to optimize the trading accordingly. At the moment, there is a lack of market makers in the market, but with a double digit number of new exchanges and gateways in the pipeline, the need for market makers will increase. 
A strategy, that we will pursue as the first mover, is an aggressive approach to trading on minor exchanges where we will be able to make the significant share of the total volume and where we could afford to be more aggressive in terms of closing trades with minimal margins in order to make a potential entry less attractive for other competitors.* 

**Q4: Are there any regulation issues with the SEC regarding your concept?** 
*At the moment, RIALTO.AI has no issue with any regulatory body.* 

**Q5: Are you confident that you can negotiate lower trading fees with exchanges because you&#x27;re bringing a great deal of liquidity into the markets?** 
*Yes, we believe this will be possible for the majority of exchanges. Some are offering custom fee arrangements for market makers by default, with others we have to negotiate on the individual basis.* 

**Q6: What will happen to RIALTO.AI&#x27;s arbitrage strategy given the impending threat and advent of protocols like 0x (ZRX) and Kyber Network?** 
*We are welcoming the announcements of aforementioned and similar projects, even though the majority is still in early stage. We see this as one segment of blockchain and cryptocurrency transaction processing system. Each segment has a different level of differentiations, among others: fiat transactions, different user end applications, and local market differentiations. For example, the financial institutions that are looking to enter the industry have different goals for their solutions as potential users of a decentralized exchange. We do not believe that one segment will take over the market share of the entire system. There is a need for connectivity between segments and that is why we believe that also the need for market making between participants will still exist in the foreseeable future.* 

**Q7: Will Rialto.ai be providing any sort of financial statements, performance updates to its token-holders? It would be nice to predict dividend payouts and will greatly mitigate the chances of pump and dump schemes while keeping the price of the token stable (or growing at a healthy rate)** 
*The trade statistics will be accessible for registered token holders (registration will be possible in the second half of the September). This will enable monitoring of past performance and the extrapolation of data for performance predictions. We will also publish quarterly reports on the trading, operations, and other activities. It is in our interest to provide the most accurate data and guidance possible in order for the value of XRL token to resemble the intrinsic value.* 

**Q8: If you had to ballpark it, how much do you expect the first dividend to payout and the second. Maybe a range?** 
*Trade statistics will be accessible to registered token holders which will enable the projections of the performance range. We will not publish any official guidance on the predicted performance of the trading system. Performance is closely tied to the number of exchanges and gateways connected to the system. We will start with those that passed the background check, which are currently two exchanges and a Ripple gateway. We are testing another two exchanges on which the evaluation will be finished in October.*

**Q9: How far along is the arbitrage bot/trade bot? When will we see this being used?** 
*The bot is in use and optimization is being applied constantly. Trading data will be accessible to registered token holders. To actually see it in use, please visit us at the Blockchain Solutions Forum in Barcelona.* 

**Q10: You mentioned that Rialto will eventually be in a unique position to create an exchange with the cheapest &#x27;world rates. Will this fall under the same company with 100% of the profits being distributed to token holders? Or would that be a separate ICO / project?**
*RIALTO.AI is one existing project. The feature with the ability to purchase or sell tokens through RIALTO.AI user interface is planned for September 2018.* [deleted] During arbitrage operation, will profits be compounded as additional leverage for Rialto trading or are they pooled away for future distribution only? One question a lot of people are dying to know:
Which exchanges are you in talks with? Are you confident that you can negotiate lower trading fees with exchanges because you&#x27;re bringing a great deal of liquidity into the markets? Will Rialto.ai be providing any sort of financial statements, performance updates to its token-holders? It would be nice to predict dividend payouts and will greatly mitigate the chances of pump and dump schemes while keeping the price of the token stable (or growing at a healthy rate)  Question for the RIALTO.AI team:

What will happen to RIALTO.AI&#x27;s arbitrage strategy given the impending threat and advent of protocols like 0x (ZRX) and Kyber Network?

Please kindly respond.

Thank you! How far along is the artitrage bot / trade bot? When will we see this being used? You mentioned that Rialto will eventually be in a unique position to create an exchange with the cheapest &#x27;world rates. Will this fall under the same company with 100% of the profits being distributed to token holders? Or would that be a seperate ICO / project? Are there any regulation issues with the SEC regarding your concept? Would Rialto.ai inform its supporters prior to selling the technology/algorithms/IP to a 3rd party? The whitepaper suggests 100% of all profits (&quot;additional net value created&quot;) will be distributed to tokenholders each period. Did you consider, or is it also possible, that Rialto could reinvest some portion of its profits back into the fund? Which framework will you be using for your machine learning models? Tensorflow, PyTorch or something else?  Why is your white paper so handwavy when it comes to the machine learning details? That&#x27;s your core offering, and in fact, that lack of details is what triggers the red alarm for someone like me who works in the field too. 

Do you plan to release a proper whitepaper with more details? I don&#x27;t expect a peer review thing, but at least put it up on arxiv if indeed you managed to come up with a model that integrates contextual information with time series data, and it performs well. Or is that promotional material, currently called a &#x27;whitepaper&#x27; on your site, all you have for now?  Semi-annual profit distributions...are there any plans to do distributions more often?  What about people gaming the system, just buying loads of tokens before the payout and dumping thereafter...Any plans to address something like this with the smart contract? Fringe case scenario: If the Ethereum network and community is plagued with politics and technical issues (perhaps using BTC as an example, with endless forks threats and mining issues), and it is only foreseeable to get much worse + there is another blockchain without such issues or concerns, will you consider to migrate XRL tokens and payouts to another platform?

I see XRL as blockchain neutral, so knowing that this is an option of last resort gives me much confidence and trust in the long run of Rialto and their team, and also the safety of my investment. What about decentralized exchange arbitrage? Won&#x27;t rialto be missing out by trading on dying centralized exchanges? With the advent of 0x, the game has changes guys. Is rialto already obsolete? How has the 0x decntralized model affected your plans? Are there any plans to integrate Rialto into the system? The Rialto team has said of the reason to distribute 100% of profits to token holders and not increase pool size is because Rialto has calculated the optimal pool size. I&#x27;m primarily interested in the dividend payments, so I&#x27;d like to see the pool compound itself so we get dividend payment growth. Since markets change over time, is Rialto planning to recalculate the optimal pool size on an ongoing regular basis, and if advantageous, change the optimal pool size to retain some earnings for growth?   I noticed you don&#x27;t currently have a video supporting the people, technology &amp;amp; business. I feel that this could really compliment the project. So my question is, will you let one of your supporters (me) come in and meet you guys and make a short 5 minute documentary about this incredible project? First congrats on the project! How are you guys going to be sharing the profits (if any) with us investors? As the Rialto AI team continues testing its model - are you using historical or live market data? 

If historical, have you tested the model in scenarios where the market is falling and what were the differences/results that you observed? [deleted] I realised decentralised exchanges could potentially pose a decent risk to Rialto. If you therefore need to pivot the business model can we expect you to maintain the company and continue as Rialto is this occurs? I understand part of the capital raised in the ICO will be used in the trading pool. Will money coming from institutional investors be partially allocated to the pool? [deleted] On the whitepaper there is a photo of a laptop with RIALTO program on the screen. Will that be a website for user to use? Reddit is a very good choice. Actually hate FB and Twitter. Reddit is much better for serious talk.  Can you elaborate on details regarding the selection of the audit firm, and your expected costs of audit? The whitepaper does not reference a specific cost category in Figure 10. (Allocation of funds gathered during crowdsale) in relation to audit fees, unless it&#x27;s supposed to fall under the IT Security and Compliance costs.

The few audit firms who can handle the complex nature of auditing Rialto are a bit pricey, so I&#x27;m curious to see how bids are coming along and if they are still in line with the initial budget. If the model is proven to be good and profitable, what is the next step for the company? In other words, will you consider expanding the pool in the future, or this is a one-shot experiment.

[](#bot) To the redditors as well: Let me see If I get it right, they want to be like a market maker broker, like a mega exchange, an exchange between exchanges. They want to do that arbitrage people are already doing right now with bots or manually, but they want to do it better and efficiently. And they offer us to fund them by buying their coin in exchange of a profit sharing of that arbitrage?
ps. Sorry for my spelling Quick question: if the price per Rialto token goes above the dividend amount, does that mean it&#x27;s overpriced? For example, if Rialto pays its token holders $0.50 per token in dividends, does that mean that anything over $0.50 is overpaying? Or are there other factors that would increase the price of the Rialto token? Also, does the dividend-per-coin fluctuate based on how much revenue the company is earning? Thanks!</pre></body></html>
