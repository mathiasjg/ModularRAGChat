Undergrad engineer here. I&#x27;ve grown curious about neuroscience broadly, but particularly OBEs, sleep, and consciousness. I&#x27;m aware dunning kruger is present here.

I want to understand what a neuroscientist&#x27;s (and sleep researcher if there are any here ) work is like.

What is your day to day experience? What did you do in your undergrad that helped later on? What kind of work is available for undergrads?

Thanks!In my case, sitting in front of a computer all day. I have a less traditional role where processing and analysis of big, complex combined neural activity / behavioral datasets is basically all I do. The lab I work in does experiments where we record (in video format) the activity of many individual neurons while an animal is doing something, and we also record video of what the animal is doing. My day to day work centers around turning that into something interesting. 

In my case I&#x27;ve had undergraduates come in with some programming skills and be able to learn to analyze data at least partly on their own, but that&#x27;s less common. I work in a neuro-behavior core, it&#x27;s pretty awesome. Mostly I run mice and rats through mazes all day and they pay me for it. Of course once I&#x27;m done I have to handle all the data, prepare a database, graphs and report for the researcher or lab that requested the testing. I also set up new equipment, do a lot of troubleshooting, curse at cameras and struggle to get good focus without a glare that will mess up my tracking.  This afternoon I hung out with some of the rats and gave them snacks and pets but it&#x27;s a laid back Friday before a holiday.

An average day - I roll into work and check my email and computer stuff while I finish my coffee and have a snack. Head into the vivarium and setup for my experiment. Maybe run a set of mice in Elevated Plus Maze. I clean up and download any data I need. Then I go to the gym and lunch. Afterwards I enter all my data and prepare a report and handle any paper/computer work. Then I prep for the next day.  I&#x27;ve worked on a ton of different projects including training AI to recognize mouse anatomy and positions. Some days I&#x27;m running animals literally all day, some days I&#x27;m just sitting at my desk working on excel sheets or reports. It gives me a nice variety.

I didn&#x27;t do any research in my undergrad, I was working full time and volunteering at the zoo.  All of my animal experience has played heavily into my job since it revolves around mice and rats. We had a college student until this spring who would hand score videos and handled a lot of the office stuff. I&#x27;m a physician scientist in my neurology residency. When I&#x27;m working in lab, it&#x27;s very similar to other cell bio labs, cell culture, western blots, imaging. I just get to use neurons which are cool.


For patient care, I rotate on inpatient services where I care for people with stroke, MS, epilepsy, etc who are hospitalized. I also rotate on outpatient services helping manage chronic neuro conditions (the ones above + Parkinson&#x27;s, dementia, neuromuscular)


In undergrad, getting a really solid base for biology, chemistry, and human physiology was really helpful. Starting to build skills for reading and understanding scientific literatures, doing experiments, and analyzing data. A lot of this doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be neuro focused since it carries over from field to field 90% research 10% consultation/explanation.

Almost no work is available within the field for undergrads. Panic.

Wake up, panic you need to get in to work and know the commute into a university will get exponentially worse with every minute so you need to get to work early.

Panic once you are at work thinking about everything that needs to get done 

Panic in your soul freaking out about funding and your job security.

Panic as you write grants 

Panic as you analyze data recognizing that when you try to power an experiment for 0.05 you will likely land a 0.06 and need to redo everything that can take months or years.

Panic that your lab staff are actually doing work correctly.

Panic that you aren&#x27;t doing enough at work to make tenure.

Panic that you won&#x27;t have money to keep your people employed.

Panic that you missed or will be late to another meeting.

Panic when you get reviews back about your grants and papers.

Life as a scientist is constant panic. But if you can manage to just live in the fire, the gig is pretty sweet. PhD MD researcher in BCI and cognitive neuroscience here. To be honest, you&#x27;re always behind your tasks, you never finish learning, and you have to wear hats...so many freaking different hats... At times you think it will drive you insane, but the job is great, and is kind of fun that people outside your field look at you in awe, or don&#x27;t know how to keep talking to you because they think you are a martian or something  I&#x27;ve personally worked in both mice and human labs, so I can tell you the day to day is different in both. Mice/rats is more bench work, PCRs and experiments, behavioral tests etc. while humans depends on the lab. Working with participants can be a pain sometimes with scheduling but I love people and working with people, that&#x27;s why I got into this field. Sleep and consciousness research specifically varies - I know of researchers looking at consciousness in wake vs sleep, in coma or locked in syndrome, in mind altering substances or without, some human models some mice.. it truly is a wide world and quite new, only been around for ~30 years in the neuro world. Do be careful though, sleep studies might require you to be up all night monitoring eeg and other bio signals as an RA lol. Good luck(-: I work in neurotech/sleeptech as the founder of [AffectableSleep.com](http://AffectableSleep.com) . I&#x27;m not a neuroscientists, however we have a neuroscientist on the team, a neuroscience undergrad, and we work closely with sleep researchers (though few of those have degrees in neuro. 

Strangely, our employee with a neuroscience degree works in marketing, and I&#x27;ve had multiple other neuroscientists approach us about working in a marketing/communications capacity. This isn&#x27;t completely a crazy idea as we do support research in sleep, specifically focused on slow-wave enhancement, and they like communicating about the science and research. 

Our neuroscience undergrad is doing a dual degree in software engineering and neuroscience. The combination is valuable for understanding and developing systems to measure/alter brain activity through stimulation. 

If you want to get into sleep research, I think it&#x27;s important to have more researchers with a neuro focus so we can move away from the &quot;time-based&quot; model of sleep, and focus on what we call functional sleep health, the neurological processes that make sleep beneficial.

We&#x27;re based in Sydney, Australia, and there is a surprising amount of neuro here (synchron, emotiv, cochlear, a bunch of concussion companies, etc etc).

Hope that helps and happy to answer any other questions. Do you want to work with animals or people? The answer to what the job looks like is pretty different depending on this.

As an undergrad, any volunteer position in a lab on campus (ideally a neuro lab) would work fine.</pre></body></html>
