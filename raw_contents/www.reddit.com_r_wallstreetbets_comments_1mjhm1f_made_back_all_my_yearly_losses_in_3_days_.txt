Started trading stocks in the middle of January, after trying forex for years. Slow losses over and over.  Found spy options.  First day trading them, I went from around $11000 to over $40000, then closed position at around $7500.  The next day I tried again, took my $7500 to over $11000, then wound up closing position with around $4000 in account.  I really had no idea what I was doing or how the contracts would diminish in value as the day went on.
The last few weeks have been a cycle of a few good days, then blow account on a bad trade by not getting out when it went against me.  Deposit more money, rinse and repeat.
Last Friday I was down to about $700 in my account, threw another $1000 on top of it, and was able to turn that into $4600 on spy, which is where I started on Monday. 
This week I still did a few spy trades, but switched primarily to spx.  And these last 3 days have been incredible.  My account has gone from $4600&gt;$9600&gt;$30000&gt;$93000 today.  
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get the usual comments about working at Wendy‚Äôs, put it on roulette, luck in a bull market, etc‚Ä¶.and that‚Äôs cool. 
Just excited to share this incredible journey

### Redditor's Trading Strategy: SPX High-Risk Options

This redditor, a former forex trader, focuses on high-risk, high-reward trading of SPX options, specifically using 1DTE (1 day to expiration) or possibly 0DTE (0 days to expiration) contracts. His strategy is based on pre-market analysis of SPY, followed by a momentum-based trade on SPX. He acknowledges the luck involved but emphasizes the importance of discipline and learning from mistakes.

---

### Key Elements of the Strategy

* **Assets Traded:** He primarily trades **SPX options** with a focus on **1DTE** (1 Day to Expiration) contracts, which he sometimes holds overnight, though he mentions a preference for a quick exit. He also alludes to using 0DTE options. He chose SPX over SPY for its tax benefits. ["I switched over to SPX and buy calls or puts...", "the big trade I closed today was a 1dte I opened yesterday", "spx offers better tax benefits"]
* **Full Portfolio Allocation:** The redditor confirms he does "full port" trades, which means he allocates his entire portfolio to a single trade. This is an extremely high-risk approach. ["I did full port, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was just hope for the best"]
* **Pre-Market Analysis:** The process starts by analyzing the **SPY pre-market chart** to identify key levels. He looks for highs, lows, and support and resistance lines in the hours before the market opens. ["I first look at pre market chart for SPY, look for highs/lows but also support/resistance in those hours."]
* **Entry Signal:** He waits for the market to open to confirm a direction. Once a clear trend is established, he buys calls or puts on SPX to ride that momentum. He waits "within first 15-30 mins of open" to make his move. ["Wait for market to open to see what direction it‚Äôs going, then switch over to SPX and buy calls or puts in that direction."]
* **Option Moneyness:** He prefers to buy options that are **very close to ITM** (In-The-Money). This is a common strategy for day traders to manage time decay while still benefiting from high delta (the rate at which an option's price changes relative to a $1 move in the underlying asset). ["normally very close to ITM."]
* **Exit Strategy:** He uses **Fibonacci extensions** as a primary tool for setting profit targets, specifically looking to exit around the **1.75-2.0 fib extension**. He also considers recent highs and lows. He emphasizes getting out "as soon as possible" to lock in profits. ["I primarily look at getting out around 1.75-2.0 fib extension, but I also look at recent highs and lows to judge exits. I like to get out as soon as possible."] 
* **Risk Management &amp; Psychology:** He explicitly states that his biggest past failures were due to a poor mindset. He mentions having to overcome **FOMO** (Fear of Missing Out), making a guess instead of waiting for confirmation, and "hold hoping for a turn around" instead of cutting losses. This implies he's now working on a more disciplined approach to avoid these pitfalls, but still full ports his trades. ["Mindset. FOMO would get the best of me. I‚Äôd guess a direction instead of waiting for a confirmation. And then hold hoping for a turn around."]

### Financial Details and Rationale

* **Contract Cost:** SPX contracts are significantly more expensive than SPY contracts, often costing $1,000-$1,500 each, compared to SPY contracts which are about one-tenth of that. This requires substantial capital for trading. ["Spx contracts normally run me around 1000-1500 each Spy contracts are about 1/10 of that"]
* **Tax Benefits:** He switched from SPY to SPX options because he was hopeful of becoming profitable and knew that SPX contracts qualify for **Section 1256 tax treatment**. This means that 60% of gains are taxed as long-term capital gains, and 40% are taxed as short-term capital gains, regardless of how long the position was held. This is a significant advantage over the 100% short-term tax rate for regular options gains. ["I liked trading spy, but was hopeful I would get profitable and spx offers better tax benefits", "It qualifies for section 1256, meaning that 60% of your gains are taxed as long term capital gains, and the remaining 40% are taxed as short term capital gains."]
* **Experience &amp; Education:** He attributes his ability to read charts to his experience trading forex on and off for years. ["I do feel starting there has helped me to be able to read charts better"] He also acknowledges that his success is a mix of skill and luck. ["Every win and loss has been a lesson. Obviously there is some luck involved in trading."]

### Summary

This trader's strategy is a structured, yet highly aggressive, day trading method. It involves using pre-market analysis and Fibonacci extensions to frame a high-conviction, full-portfolio trade on SPX options. Unlike TheCinemaGod, he implicitly acknowledges the possibility of losses and the need for a disciplined mindset, but his full-port approach is still a major risk factor. His focus on SPX is a financially savvy move for a trader who anticipates being profitable, due to the substantial tax benefits.
