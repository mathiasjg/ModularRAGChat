Strongest Lyrics [Verse 1]  
You sit there with that look on your face like you won  
Like nothing I say is gonna change how you feel now.  
You sit there and you tell me you fell out of love,  
And we are in your way so you just gotta leave now.  
And we just need to understand your reasons,  
And you are gonna justify this treason.  
By telling me the promises that we swore ain't enough.

[Pre-Chorus]  
So now you gonna be another person?  
And how do I explain this shit to our son?  
How do you tell a toddler about a girlfriend?  
Daddy's gone.

[Chorus]  
Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew.  
I will be there when he needs a love strong enough.  
Don't worry; I will carry your share for us.  
No matter how bad the storm,  
I will be the strongest that he ever knew.  
And we'll leave you alone.

[Verse 2]
You sit there with your phone in your hands and you're hurt.
You tell me that you feel like you lost me when he came.
I'm sorry but I cannot connect with your words,
'Cause right now what matters isn't yours, but it is his name.
And we just need to find another income
'Cause she wants you to help her with her own.
And you want me to tell me that what you've done is okay.

[Pre-Chorus]
So now are you gonna be another father?
And I will be a different kind of mother?
And would you tell a toddler 'bout step brothers?
Daddy's strayed.

[Chorus]
Well, I will be the strongest he ever knew,
And I will be there when he needs love strong enough.
Don't worry; I'll carry your share for us.
No matter how bad the storm, I will be
The strongest he ever knew.
And we'll leave you alone.

The love that we had in this family  
Let's talk about honesty  

You know nothing about honesty  

I'll let go of your hands and our plans  
And the chance that we had with this family  

[Chorus]  
Well, I will be the strongest he ever knew  
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough  
Don't worry, I will carry your share for us  
No matter how bad the storm, I will be strongest he ever knew  
And we'll leave you alone  
Oh na-na, we'll leave you alone
