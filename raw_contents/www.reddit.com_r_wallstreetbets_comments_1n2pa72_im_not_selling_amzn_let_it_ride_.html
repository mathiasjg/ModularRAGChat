AMZN 9/12 240C $GOOGL X $AMZN  x $META port has returned me almost $250K YTD

60K AWAY FROM 1M https://preview.redd.it/22xpesl57wlf1.jpeg?width=1179&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42f4cc3f76031e0a6150728bd06592d219713f20 $AMZNing play 240s not impossible but chances are theta and premium price will eat your possible gains so close to expiration.  But Ive eaten my words before so who knows. If it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot it‚Äôs good enough to sell. Did everyone forget about prime day? Amazon said thanks for the annual $139.99 My wife said the same thing now I‚Äôm 18 years in the hole. You held too long with a 1-week expiry. You should&#x27;ve sold when you posted, especially going into a 3-day weekend when hedge funds love to rug pull. You won&#x27;t do this next time though, hopefully, so at least it&#x27;s a lesson learned. Bro making 30k in a day while I‚Äôm out here fighting overdraft fees. Calls into September, a sus month. Truly regarded This didn&#x27;t age well.  Looks like the 10k gain turned to a 10k loss in 18 hours
There&#x27;s still time. Double down? He‚Äôll be posting with a loss tag soon Annnddd it‚Äôs gone Is ‚ÄúI read somewhere that Warren Buffett bought some‚Äù good enough DD Not far enough OTM for these long dates!
