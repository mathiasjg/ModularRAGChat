The World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition was established in 1977 to answer the adage, &quot;Who is the strongest man in the world?&quot; Since then, WSM has crowned champions worldwide—legends such as Mariusz Pudzianowski, Eddie Hall, Žydrūnas Savickas, and the late Jón Pall Sigmarsson. The 2025 SBD World&#x27;s Strongest Man in Sacramento, California, was one of the most competitive in our history.

Since our founding, strongman has become a truly global sport with worldwide participation. This has given rise to today’s generation of elite competitors. It also means you, the fans, travel to support your nation and favorite strongman to witness truly remarkable feats of human strength in person.</pre>
